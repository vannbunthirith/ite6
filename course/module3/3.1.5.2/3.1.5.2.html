        <h1>Connect Power to the Internal Drive and Case Fans</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Traditionally, HDDs and optical drives were powered by a 4-pin Molex power connector. These drives now typically use a 15-pin SATA connector, as shown in Figure 1. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For flexibility, some drives have both a 15-pin SATA connector and a 4-pin Molex connector. On these drives, use only one of the power connectors, never both. Many older power supplies may not have SATA connectors. A Molex-to-SATA adapter, as shown in Figure 2, can be used to connect drives.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The steps to connect the SATA cable to a drive are:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>Align the 15-pin SATA power connector to the port on the drive.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>(Figure 3) Gently push in the connector until the connector is fully seated.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Installation Tip:</b> Be very careful when connecting SATA cables. If they are pressed at an angle, they can snap the connector off of the drive.</p>
          <p>Other peripheral devices, such as the case fans, also need to be powered. Most motherboards provide 3-pin or 4-pin connectors to connect fans. The basic steps to power case fans include:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>Align the 3-pin or 4-pin fan power connector to the port on the motherboard.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>(Figure 4) Gently press down on the connector until the connector is fully seated.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Plug any remaining cables from the case into the appropriate connectors according to the motherboard and case manual.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Installation Tip: </b>3-pin fan power connectors can be attached to 4-pin ports. The connector and the socket are keyed so that they will fit together even though one pin is left unconnected.</p>
