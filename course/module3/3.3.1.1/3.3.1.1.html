        <h1>Motherboard Component Upgrades</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Computers need periodic upgrades for various reasons:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>User requirements change</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Upgraded software packages require new hardware</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>New hardware offers enhanced performance</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Changes to the computer may cause you to upgrade or replace components and peripherals. Research the effectiveness and cost for both upgrading and replacing.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If you upgrade or replace a motherboard, consider that you might have to replace other components including the CPU, heat sink and fan assembly, and RAM. A new motherboard must also fit into the old computer case and the power supply must support it.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When upgrading the motherboard, begin the upgrade by moving the CPU and the heat sink and fan assembly to the new motherboard if they will be reused. These items are much easier to work with when they are outside of the case. Work on an antistatic mat, and wear antistatic gloves or an antistatic wrist strap to avoid damaging the CPU. If the new motherboard requires a different CPU and RAM, install them at this time. Clean the thermal compound from the CPU and heat sink. Remember to re-apply thermal compound between the CPU and the heat sink. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many older motherboards had jumpers that were moved between pins to change settings. However, newer motherboards rarely have jumpers. Advanced electronics allow these options to be configured from within the UEFI or BIOS setup program.</p>
          <p>CMOS batteries last several years. However, if the computer does not keep the correct time and date, or loses configuration settings between shutdowns, the battery is most likely dead and must be replaced. Make sure that the new battery matches the model required by the motherboard.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To install a CMOS battery, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>Gently slide aside, or raise, the thin metal clips to remove the old battery.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>Line up the positive and negative poles to the correct orientation.</p>
