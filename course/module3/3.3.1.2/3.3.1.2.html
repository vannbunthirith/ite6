        <h1>Upgrade the Motherboard</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Before beginning an upgrade, ensure that you know where and how everything is connected. Always make notes in a journal to record how the current computer is setup. A quick way is to use a cell phone and take pictures of important items such as how components connect to the motherboard.  These pictures may prove to be surprisingly helpful when re-assembling. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To upgrade a motherboard from a computer case, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>Record how the the power supply, case fans, case LEDs, and case buttons attach to the old motherboard.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> Disconnect the cables from the old motherboard. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> Disconnect the expansion cards from the case. Remove each expansion card and place them in antistatic bags, or on an antistatic mat.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4.</b> Carefully record how the old motherboard is secured to the case. Some mounting screws provide support while some may provide an important grounding connection between the motherboard and chassis. In particular, pay attention to screws and standoffs that are non-metallic, because these may be insulators. Replacing insulating screws and supports with metal hardware that conducts electricity might damage electrical components.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5.</b> Remove the old motherboard from the case.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 6.</b> Examine the new motherboard and identify where all of the connectors are such as power, SATA, fan, USB, audio, front panel connector, and any others.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 7.</b> Examine the I/O shield located at the back of the computer case. Replace the old I/O shield with the I/O shield that comes with the new motherboard.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 8.</b> Insert and secure the motherboard into the case. Be sure to consult the case and motherboard manufacturer user guides. Use the proper types of screws. Do not swap threaded screws with self-tapping metal screws, because they will damage the threaded screw holes and might not be secure. Make sure that the threaded screws are the correct length and have the same number of threads per inch. If the thread is correct, they fit easily. If you force a screw to fit, you can damage the threaded hole, and it will not hold the motherboard securely. Using the wrong screw can also produce metal shavings that can cause short circuits.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 9.</b> Next, connect the power supply, case fans, case LEDs, front panel, and any other required cables. If the ATX power connectors are not the same size (some have more pins than others), you might need to use an adapter. Refer to the motherboard documentation for the layout of these connections.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 10.</b> After the new motherboard is in place and the cables are connected, install and secure the expansion cards.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It is now time to check your work. Make sure that there are no loose parts or unconnected cables. Connect the keyboard, mouse, monitor, and power. If a problem is detected, shut the power supply off immediately.</p>
