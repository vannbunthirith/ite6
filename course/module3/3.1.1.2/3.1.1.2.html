        <h1>Install the Power Supply</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A technician might be required to replace or install a power supply, such as the one shown in Figure 1. Most power supplies can only fit one way in the computer case. Always follow the power supply installation directions in the case and power supply manuals.</p>
          <p>These are the basic steps to install a power supply:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>Insert the power supply into the case.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>Align the holes in the power supply with the holes in the case.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3. </b>Secure the power supply to the case using the proper screws.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Installation Tip</b>: Do not tighten all the screws until they have all been slightly hand-tightened. This will make it easier to tighten the last two screws.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Power supplies have fans that can vibrate and loosen screws that are not properly tightened. When installing a power supply, make sure that all the screws are in place and tightened correctly.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Place all unused cables into the case where they will not interfere with any other components or fans. Use a cable ties, rubber bands, or hook and loop straps to bundle power cables and keep them out of the way. To help eliminate cable clutter inside the case, some power supplies are modular. This means that only the required cables are attached to the power supply. When components are installed in the future, additional power cables are installed as they are needed. Some modular power supply cables are shown in Figure 2.</p>

            <b>Installation Tip</b>: Use a cable tie to secure all of the cables out of the way until it is time to connect them.</p>
