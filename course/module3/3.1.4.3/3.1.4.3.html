        <h1>Install a Video Adapter Card</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Video adapter cards use PCI, AGP, or PCIe expansion slots on the motherboard. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To install a video adapter card, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> Find an empty PCIe x16 slot on the case and remove the small metal cover.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>Align the video adapter card to the appropriate expansion slot on the motherboard.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3. </b>Press down gently on the video adapter card until the card is fully seated.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4. </b>Secure the video adapter card mounting bracket to the case with the appropriate screw.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many video adapter cards require separate power from the power supply using a 6-pin or 8-pin power connector. Some cards may need two of these connectors. If possible, provide some space between the video adapter and other expansion cards. Video adapters create excessive heat which is often moved away from the card with a fan.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Installation Tip: </b>Research the length of the video card (and other adapter cards) before purchase. Longer cards may not be compatible with certain motherboards. Chips and other electronics may stand in the way of the adapter card when trying to seat them in the expansion slot. Some cases might also limit the size of adapter cards that can be installed. Some adapter cards may come with mounting brackets of different heights to accommodate these cases.</p>
