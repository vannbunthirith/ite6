          <p>Assembling computers is a large part of a technician’s job. As a technician, you must work in a logical, methodical manner when working with computer components. At times, you might have to determine whether a component for a customer’s computer needs to be upgraded or replaced. It is important that you develop skills in installation procedures, troubleshooting techniques, and diagnostic methods. This chapter discusses the importance of component compatibility. It also covers the need for adequate system resources to efficiently run the customer’s hardware and software. </p>
