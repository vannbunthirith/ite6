        <h1>Upgrade the BIOS</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Motherboard manufacturers may publish updated BIOS versions to provide enhancements to system stability, compatibility, and performance. However, updating the firmware is risky. The release notes, such as those shown in Figure 1, describe the upgrade to the product, compatibility improvements, and the known bugs that have been addressed. Some newer devices operate properly only with an updated BIOS installed. To check the version of the BIOS installed in a computer, consult either the BIOS Setup (Figure 2) or UEFI BIOS utility (Figure 3).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before updating motherboard firmware, record the manufacturer of the BIOS and the motherboard model. Use this information to identify the exact files to download from the motherboard manufacturer’s site. Only update the firmware if there are problems with the system hardware or to add functionality to the system.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Early computer BIOS information was contained in ROM chips. To upgrade the BIOS information, the ROM chip had to be replaced, which was not always possible. Modern BIOS chips are Electronically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) which can be upgraded by the user without opening the computer case. This process is called flashing the BIOS.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To download a new BIOS, consult the manufacturer’s website and follow the recommended installation procedures. Installing BIOS software online may involve downloading a new BIOS file, copying or extracting files to removable media, and then booting from the removable media. An installation program prompts the user for information to complete the process.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many motherboard manufacturers now provide software to flash the BIOS from within an operating system. For example, the ASUS EZ Update utility automatically updates a motherboard’s software, drivers, and the BIOS version. It also enables a user to manually update a saved BIOS and select a boot logo when the system goes into POST. The utility is included with the motherboard, or it can be downloaded from the ASUS website.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION</b>: An improperly installed or aborted BIOS update can cause the computer to become unusable.</p>
