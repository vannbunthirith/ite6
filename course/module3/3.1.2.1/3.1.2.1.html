        <h1>Install the CPU, Heat Sink and Fan Assembly</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The CPU and the heat sink and fan assembly should be installed on the motherboard before the motherboard is placed in the computer case. This allows for extra room to see and to maneuver components during installation.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before installing a CPU on a motherboard, verify that it is compatible with the CPU socket, as shown in Figure 1. Motherboards are designed to work with specific types of CPUs and not all CPUs use the same motherboard socket. The table in Figure 2 describes the common socket types and installation notes. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: SEC and LIF are legacy socket connections.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The CPU and motherboard are highly sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD can easily damage these components if they are mishandled. Therefore, always place components on an antistatic mat and wear a wrist strap (or antistatic gloves) when installing and removing CPUs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION</b>: When handling a CPU, do not touch the CPU contacts at any time. Place a CPU on the antistatic mat until you are ready to use it. Store CPUs in antistatic packaging.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To install a CPU and heat sink and fan assembly on a motherboard, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>Align the CPU pin 1 with the socket pin 1, as shown in Figure 3. Look for a dot on the CPU and a triangle on the socket to indicate pin 1. Check the CPU and motherboard documentation to ensure alignment. Place the CPU gently into the socket. Never force the CPU into its socket, as excessive force can easily damage the CPU and the socket. Stop if you encounter any resistance and make sure that you have aligned the CPU properly.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>The CPU is secured to the socket on the motherboard with a latch plate. Close the CPU latch plate as shown in Figure 4. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> Secure the latch plate in place by closing the load lever, as shown in Figure 5. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4</b>. Secure the load lever under the load lever retention tab, as shown in Figure 6.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5. </b>Apply thermal compound to the CPU, as shown in Figure 7. Thermal compound helps to conduct heat away from the CPU. In most cases, only a very small amount of thermal compound is required. The compound spreads out evenly under the weight and pressure of the heat sink and fan assembly. Follow the application instructions provided by the manufacturer of the thermal compound.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 6. </b>Align the heat sink and fan assembly retainers with the holes on the motherboard and place the assembly onto the CPU socket, as shown in Figure 8. Avoid pinching the CPU fan wires.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 7. </b>Tighten the assembly retainers to secure the assembly in place. Follow the instructions from the heat sink and fan assembly manufacturer carefully.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If you are installing a used CPU, clean the top of the CPU and the base of the heat sink with isopropyl alcohol and a lint-free cloth. This removes the old thermal compound and contaminants. Any contaminants left between the CPU and the heat sink decreases the ability of the thermal compound to absorb heat from the CPU. Follow the manufacturer recommendations about applying the thermal compound.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Installation Tip</b>: A paper coffee filter works well as a lint-free cloth.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Always follow the instructions provided with the motherboard during CPU installation. Click <a href="http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/LGA1150/H97-PRO_GAMER/E12029_H97-PRO_GAMER_Guide_v2_web_only_20170706.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for a sample manual.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is an image that shows a technician verifying that the CPU being installed is compatible with the motherboard socket. Figure 2 on this page is a table listing the following CPU architectures and relevant installation notes. Single-Edge Connector (SEC), align the notches on the CPU to the keys in the SEC socket. Low-Insertion Force (LIF), align the CPU so that the connection 1 indicator is lined up with pin 1 on the CPU socket. Zero-Insertion Force (ZIF), align the CPU so that the connection 1 indicator is lined up with pin 1 on the CPU socket. Pin Grid Array PGA), align the CPU so that the connection 1 indicator is lined up with pin 1 on the CPU socket. Land Grid Array (LGA), align the CPU so that the two notches on the CPU fit into the two socket extensions.
