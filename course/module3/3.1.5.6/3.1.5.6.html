        <h1>Install the Front Panel Cables</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A computer case has buttons to control power to the motherboard and lights to indicate activities. Connect these buttons and lights to the motherboard with the cables from the front of the case. Figure 1 shows some of the front panel cables commonly found in a computer case. Figure 2 shows a common system panel connector on a motherboard where the cables are connected. Writing on the motherboard near the system panel connector shows where each cable is connected. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>System panel connectors are not keyed. The following guidelines for connecting cables to the system panel connectors are generic, because no standards for labeling the case cables or the system panel connectors are defined. However, each front panel cable usually has a small arrow indicating pin 1, as shown in Figure 3. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The markings on your front panel cables and system panel connectors may be different than what is shown. Always consult the motherboard manual for diagrams and additional information about connecting front panel cables.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>System panel connectors include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Power Button </b>- The power button turns the computer on or off. If the power button fails to turn off the computer, hold down the power button for 5 seconds. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Reset Button </b>- The reset button (if available) restarts the computer without turning it off. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Power LED </b>- The power LED remains lit when the computer is on, and often blinks when the computer is in sleep mode. Each pair of LED pins on the motherboard system panel connector has pin 1 marked with a plus sign (+), as shown in Figure 4. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Drive Activity LEDs </b>- The drive activity LED remains lit or blinks when the system is reading or writing to hard drives. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>System Speaker</b> - The motherboard uses a case speaker (if available) to indicate the computer’s status. For instance, one beep indicates that the computer started without problems. If there is a hardware problem, a series of diagnostic beeps is issued to indicate the type of problem. It is important to note that the system speaker is not the same as the speakers the computer uses to play music and other audio. The system speaker cable typically uses four pins on the system panel connector. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Audio </b>- Some cases have audio ports and jacks on the outside to connect microphones, external audio equipment such as signal processors, mixing boards, and instruments. Special audio panels can also be purchased and connected directly to the motherboard. These panels can install into one or more external drive bays, or be standalone panels. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>USB </b>- USB ports are located on the outside of many computer cases. USB motherboard connectors often consist of 9 or 10 pins arranged in two rows, as shown in Figure 5. This arrangement allows for two USB connections, so USB connectors are often in pairs. Sometimes the two connectors are together in one piece, as shown in Figure 6, and can be connected to the entire USB motherboard connector. USB connectors can also have four or five pins or individual groups of four or five pins. Most USB devices only require the connection of four pins. The fifth pin is used to ground the shielding of some USB cables. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION:</b> Make sure that the motherboard connector is marked USB. FireWire connectors are very similar. Connecting a USB cable to a FireWire connector will cause damage.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The table in Figure 7 provides connecting notes on various front panel indicators.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>New cases and motherboards have USB 3.0 or may even have USB 3.1 capabilities. The USB 3.0 and 3.1 motherboard connector is similar in design to a USB connector, but has additional pins. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The basic steps to connect front panel cables include:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> Plug the power cable into the system panel connector in the location marked PWR_SW.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>Plug the reset cable into the system panel connector in the location marked RESET.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3. </b>Plug the power LED cable into the system panel connector in the location marked PWR_LED.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4. </b>Plug the drive activity LED cable into the system panel connector in the location marked HDD_LED.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5. </b>Plug the speaker cable into the system panel connector in the location marked SPEAKER.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 6. </b>Plug the USB cable into the USB connector.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 7.</b> Plug the audio cable into the audio connector.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Generally, if a button or LED does not function, the connector is incorrectly oriented. To correct this, shut down the computer and unplug it, open the case, and turn the connector around for the button or LED that does not function. To avoid wiring incorrectly, some manufacturers include a keyed pin extender that combines multiple front-panel cables (i.e., power and reset LEDs) connectors into one connector.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Installation </b>
            <b>Tip:</b> The panel connector and case cable ends are very small. Take pictures of them to locate pin 1. Because space in the case can be limited at the end of assembly, a part retriever can be used to plug the cables into the connectors.</p>
