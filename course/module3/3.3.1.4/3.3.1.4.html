        <h1>Upgrade CPU and Heat Sink and Fan Assembly</h1>
        <div>
          <p>One way to increase the power of a computer is to increase the processing speed. You can do this by upgrading the CPU. However, the CPU must meet the requirements listed in the figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The new CPU might require a different heat sink and fan assembly. The assembly must physically fit the CPU and be compatible with the CPU socket. It must also be adequate to remove the heat of the faster CPU.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION</b>: You must apply thermal compound between the new CPU and the heat sink and fan assembly.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>View thermal settings in the BIOS to determine if there are any problems with the CPU and the heat sink and fan assembly. Third-party software applications can also report CPU temperature information in an easy-to-read format. Refer to the motherboard or CPU user documentation to determine if the chip is operating in the correct temperature range. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To install additional fans in the case to help cool the computer, follow these steps: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>Align the fan so that it faces the correct direction to either draw air in or blow air out.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>Mount the fan using the predrilled holes in the case. It is common to mount fans near the top of the case to blow hot air out, and near the bottom of the case to bring air in. Avoid mounting two fans close together that are moving air in opposite directions.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3. </b>Connect the fan to the power supply or the motherboard, depending on the case fan plug type.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is an image that shows a technician about to install a new LGA CPU. The figure also lists the following requirements for installing a new CPU: the new CPU must fit into the existing CPU socket, the new CPU must be compatible with the motherboard chipset, the new CPU must operate with the existing motherboard and power supply.</div>
