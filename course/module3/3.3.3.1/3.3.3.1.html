        <h1>Upgrade Input and Output Devices</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Peripheral devices periodically need to be upgraded. For example, if the device stops operating or if you wish to improve performance and productivity, an upgrade might be necessary.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These are a few reasons for upgrading a keyboard and/or a mouse:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Change the keyboard and mouse to an ergonomic design such as those shown in Figure 1. Ergonomic devices are made to be more comfortable to use, and to help prevent repetitive motion injuries. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reconfigure the keyboard to accommodate a special task, such as typing in a second language with additional characters. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>To accommodate users with disabilities.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Monitors can be upgraded in different ways:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Add a privacy filter to prevent people to the side of a monitor from reading information on the screen. Only the user and people directly behind the user are able to read the screen. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Add an antiglare filter to prevent the glare of the sun and bright lights from reflecting off the screen. An antiglare filter makes it much easier to read the screen in the daylight or when a light is behind the user.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Add multiple monitors, such as shown in Figure 2, to increase productivity by allowing the user to display more information and move data between open programs more easily and quickly. This usually requires an advanced video adapter card to support the additional connections, or a second video adapter card must be installed.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Sometimes it is not possible to perform an upgrade using the existing expansion slots or sockets. In this case, you may be able to accomplish the upgrade using a USB connection. If the computer does not have an extra USB connection, you must install a USB adapter card or purchase a USB hub, as shown in Figure 3.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>After obtaining new hardware, you may have to install new drivers. You can usually do this by using the installation media. If you do not have the installation media, you can obtain updated drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: A signed driver is a driver that has passed the Windows hardware quality lab test and has been given a driver signature by Microsoft. Installing an unsigned driver can cause system instability, error messages, and boot problems. During hardware installation, if an unsigned driver is detected, you are asked whether you want to stop or continue the installation. Only install unsigned drivers if you trust the source of the drivers. Some Windows operating systems do not allow the installation of drivers that are not signed.</p>
