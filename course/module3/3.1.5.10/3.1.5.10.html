        <h1>Install the External Cables</h1>
        <div>
          <p>After the case panels are reattached, connect the cables to the back of the computer. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>NOTE: </b>Plug in the power cable after you have connected all other cables.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When attaching cables, ensure that they are connected to the correct locations on the computer. For example, older systems use the same type of PS/2 connector for the mouse and keyboard cables, but are color-coded to avoid being connected incorrectly. Often, an icon of the connected device, such as a keyboard, mouse, monitor, or USB symbol, is shown on the connector.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION: </b>When attaching cables, never force a connection.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To install the various external cables, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>(Figure 1) Attach the monitor cable to the video port. Secure the cable by tightening the screws on the connector. If the computer you assembled has a video adapter installed, be sure to connect the cable to the adapter, and not the motherboard video port.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>(Figure 2) Plug the keyboard cable into the PS/2 keyboard port.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3. </b>(Figure 3) Plug the mouse cable into the PS/2 mouse port.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4. </b>(Figure 4) Plug the USB cable into a USB port.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5. </b>(Figure 5) Plug the power cable into the power supply.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>NOTE: </b>Some motherboards have only one PS/2 port. Some motherboards may not have any PS/2 ports for connecting the keyboard and mouse. Connect a USB keyboard, a USB mouse, or both to this type of motherboard.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Installation Tip: </b>PS/2 to USB adapters can be used to connect older peripherals to motherboards that do not have PS/2 connectors.</p>
