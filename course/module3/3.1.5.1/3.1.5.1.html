        <h1>Connect Power to the Motherboard</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Motherboards require power to operate. They also transfer some of this power to various components connected to it. The number and type of power supply connectors required depends on the combination of motherboard and processor. The table in Figure 1 highlights the various types of connectors that can be found on a motherboard. Notice how the motherboard typically requires two power connectors. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION: </b>Be careful when connecting the power supply cables to other components. Cables, connectors, and components are designed to fit together snugly. If it is difficult to plug in a cable or other part, something is wrong. Never force a connector or component. Forcing it can damage the plug and the connector. If you have a difficult time inserting a connector, check to make sure the connector is oriented properly and there are no bent pins. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The steps to install motherboard power connectors include:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1. </b>Align the 24-pin (or 20-pin) ATX power connector to the socket on the motherboard.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2. </b>(Figure 2) Gently press down on the connector until the clip clicks into place.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3. </b>Align the 4-pin (or 8-pin) auxiliary power connector to the socket on the motherboard.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4. </b>(Figure 3) Gently press down on the connector until the clip clicks into place.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5. </b>(Figure 4) Align the CPU fan power connector to the socket on the motherboard.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 6. </b>Gently press down on the connector until it is fully seated.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Installation Tip: </b>Power connectors are keyed to fit into power sockets in one orientation. Some parts of the connector are square, while others are slightly rounded. If a connector does not look like it will fit the socket due to these shapes, remember that the slightly rounded parts will fit into square holes, but square parts will not fit into the slightly rounded holes. This is by design.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is a table listing the following descriptions for various types of connectors that can be found on a motherboard: ATX Standard: ATX, Motherboard Connector Descriptions: 20-pin main motherboard connector, 6-pin auxiliary connector. ATX Standard: ATX12V v2.x, Motherboard Connector Descriptions: 24-pin main motherboard connector, 4-pin auxiliary connector. ATX Standard: AMD GES, Motherboard Connector Descriptions: 24-pin main motherboard connector, 8-pin auxiliary connector. ATX Standard: EPS12V, Motherboard Connector Descriptions: 24-pin main motherboard connector, 8-pin auxiliary connector often provided as two combined 4-pin connectors. Figure 2 on this page is an image that shows a technician connecting the 24-pin ATX12V v2.x main motherboard connector to the motherboard. Figure 3 on this page is an image that shows a technician connecting the 4-pin ATX12V v2.x auxiliary power connector to the motherboard. Figure 4 on this page is an image that shows a technician connecting the 4-pin CPU fan to the motherboard.</div>
