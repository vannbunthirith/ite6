        <h1>Benefits of Preventive Maintenance</h1>
        <div>
          <p>There are several considerations for preventive maintenance plans. Preventive maintenance plans are developed based on at least two factors:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Computer location or environment</b> - Computers that are exposed to dusty environments, such as those used on construction sites, as shown in the figure, require more attention than computers located in an office environment. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Computer use</b> - High-traffic networks, such as a school network, might require additional scanning and removal of malicious software and unwanted files. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Document the routine maintenance tasks that must be performed on the computer components and the frequency of each task. You can then use this list of tasks to create a preventive maintenance plan. </p>
          <p>Be proactive in computer maintenance and data protection. By performing regular maintenance routines, you can reduce potential hardware and software problems. Regular maintenance routines reduce computer downtime and repair costs. Preventive maintenance also offers these benefits:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Improves data protection</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Extends the life of the components</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Improves equipment stability</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduces the number of equipment failures</li>
            </ul>
