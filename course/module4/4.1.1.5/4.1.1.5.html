        <h1>Environmental Concerns</h1>
        <div>
          <p>An optimal operating environment for a computer is clean, free of potential contaminants, and within the temperature and humidity range specified by the manufacturer. With most desktop computers, the operating environment can be controlled. However, due to the portable nature of laptops, it is not always possible to control the temperature, humidity, and working conditions. Computers are built to resist adverse environments, but technicians should always take precautions to protect the computer from damage and loss of data. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Follow these guidelines to help ensure optimal computer operating performance: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not obstruct vents or airflow to the internal components.  </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Keep the room temperature between 45 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (7 to 32 degrees Celsius). </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Keep the humidity level between 10 and 80 percent. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Temperature and humidity recommendations vary by computer manufacturer. You should research these recommended values if you plan to use the computer in extreme conditions. Refer to the figure for humidity and temperature examples. </p>
