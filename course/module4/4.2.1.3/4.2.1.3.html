Open-ended questions: What problems are you experiencing with your computer or network? What software has been installed on your computer recently? What were you doing when the problem was identified? What hardware changes have been made recently to your computer? Closed ended questions: Has anyone else used your computer recently? Have you received any error messages on your computer? Can you reproduce the problem? Have you changed your password recently? Are you currently logged into the network?</div>
