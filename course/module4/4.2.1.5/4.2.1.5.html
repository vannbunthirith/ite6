        <h1>Test the Theory to Determine Cause</h1>
        <div>
          <p>You can determine an exact cause by testing your theories of probable causes one at a time, starting with the quickest and easiest. Figure 1 identifies some common steps to determine the cause of the problem. After identifying an exact cause of the problem, you then determine the steps to resolve the problem. As you become more experienced at troubleshooting computers, you will work through the steps in the process faster. For now, practice each step to better understand the troubleshooting process.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If you cannot determine the exact cause of the problem after testing all your theories, establish a new theory of probable cause and test it. If necessary, escalate the problem to a technician with more experience. Before you escalate, document each test that you tried, as shown in Figure 2.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page lists the following common steps to determine the cause of the problem, used as part of the third step of troubleshooting which is, test the theory to determine cause: ensure the device is powered on., ensure the power switch for an outlet is turned on., ensure the surge protector is turned on., ensure external cable connections are secure., ensure that there are no disks in the floppy drive., verify the boot order in BIOS setup.Figure 2 on this page is an image of a help desk support form which gives the problem descriptions and solutions tried as well as important information regarding the laptop or computer.</div>
