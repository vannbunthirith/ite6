        <h1>Authentication Services</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Access to network devices is typically controlled through authentication, authorization, and accounting services. Referred to as AAA or “triple A”, these services provide the primary framework to set up access control on a network device. AAA is a way to control who is permitted to access a network (authenticate), what they can do while they are there (authorize), and track what actions they perform while accessing the network (accounting).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This concept is similar to using a credit card, as indicated by the figure. The credit card identifies who can use it, how much that user can spend, and keeps account of what items or services the user purchased.</p>
