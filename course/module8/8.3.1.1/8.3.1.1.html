        <h1>Data Center</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As organizations evolve, they require increasing amounts of computing power and hard drive storage space. If left unaddressed, this will impact an organization’s ability to provide vital services. The loss of vital services means lower customer satisfaction, lower revenue, and, in some situations, loss of property or life.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Large enterprises typically own a data center to manage the storage and data access needs of the organization. In these single tenant data centers, the enterprise is the only customer or tenant using the data center services. However, as the amount of data continues to expand, even large enterprises are expanding their data storage capacity by utilizing the services of third-party data centers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Currently, there are over 3,000 data centers in the world that offer general hosting services to organizations. There are many more data centers that are owned and operated by private industry for their own use.</p>
