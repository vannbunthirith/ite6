        <h1>WiMAX</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) is an IP-based wireless 4G broadband technology that offers high-speed mobile Internet access for mobile devices, as shown in the figure. WiMAX is a standard called IEEE 802.16e. It supports a MAN-sized network and has download speeds up to 70 Mb/s and distances up to 30 miles (50 km). Security and QoS for WiMAX are equivalent to cellular networks.</p>
          <p>WiMAX uses a low wavelength transmission, usually between 2 GHz to 11 GHz. These frequencies are not as easily disrupted by physical obstructions because they can better bend around obstacles than higher frequencies. Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology is supported, which means additional antennas can be added to increase the potential throughput. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are two methods of transmitting a WiMAX signal:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Fixed WiMAX</b> - A point-to-point or point-to-multipoint service with speeds up to 72 Mb/s and a range of 30 miles (50 km).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Mobile WiMAX</b> - A mobile service, like Wi-Fi, but with higher speeds and a longer transmission range.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page shows an ISP network sending the signal through a cable to a WiMax transmitter. The WiMax transmitter then relays the signal to a second WiMax transmitter which broadcasts the signal to a home which is in line of sight.</div>
