        <h1>Selecting a NIC</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A NIC is required to connect to the network. As shown in Figure 1, there are different types of NICs. Ethernet NICs are used to connect to Ethernet networks and wireless NICs are used to connect to 802.11 wireless networks. Most NICs in desktop computers are integrated into the motherboard or connected to an expansion slot. NICs are also available in a USB form factor. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 lists questions to consider when purchasing a new NIC.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You must be able to upgrade, install, and configure components when a customer asks for increased speed or new functionality to be added to a network. If your customer is adding additional computers or wireless functionality, you should be able to recommend equipment based on their needs, such as wireless access points and wireless network cards. The equipment that you suggest must work with the existing equipment and cabling, or the existing infrastructure must be upgraded. In rare cases, you might need to update the driver. </p>

Figure 2 on this page is a diagram that lists the following questions to consider when purchasing a new NIC. Type of NIC: Wired (Fast or Gigabit Ethernet)? Wireless 802.11n/802.11ac? Connection type: Expansion slot (PCI/PCIe)? USB? Advanced NIC Features: Wake on LAN (WoL)? Quality of Service (QoS)? Cost?</div>
