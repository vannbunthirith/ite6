        <h1>File Services</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) was standardized in 1971 to allow for data transfers between a client and a server. An FTP client is an application that runs on a computer that is used to push and pull data from a server running FTP as a service.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As the figure illustrates, to successfully transfer data, FTP requires two connections between the client and the server, one for commands and replies, the other for the actual file transfer.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>FTP has many security weaknesses. Therefore, a more secure file transfer services should be used, such as one of the following:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS)</b> - An FTP client can request the file transfer session be encrypted using TLS. The file server can accept or deny the request.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>SSH  File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)</b> - As an extension to Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, SFTP can be used to establish a secure file transfer session.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Secure Copy (SCP)</b> - SCP also uses SSH to secure file transfers.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a topology that shows a client and a server connected to a network. The client opens the first connection to the server for control traffic. The client opens the second connection for data traffic. Data flows through the network between the devices.</div>
