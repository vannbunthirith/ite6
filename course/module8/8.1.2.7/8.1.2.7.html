        <h1>Testing Connectivity with the Windows GUI</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When all devices are connected and all link lights are functioning, test the network for connectivity. The easiest way to test for an Internet connection is to open a web browser and see if the Internet is available. To troubleshoot a wireless connection, you can use the Windows GUI or CLI.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To verify a wireless connection in Windows Vista, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Start > Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Manage Network Connections</b>. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To verify a wired or wireless connection in Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Start > Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings</b>. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Windows 7 and Vista, wired network connections are normally called ‘Local Area Connection’, as shown in Figure 1. In Windows 8 and 8.1, wired network connections are called ‘Ethernet’, as shown in Figure 2. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Double-click the network connection to display the status screen, as shown for Windows 7 in Figure 3. The status screen displays whether the computer is connected to the Internet, along with the duration of the connection. It also shows the number of sent and received bytes. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In all Windows versions, click the <b>Details</b> button to view IP addressing information, subnet mask, default gateway, MAC address, and other information, as shown in Figure 4. If the connection is not functioning correctly, close the Details window and click <b>Diagnose</b> to reset the connection information and attempt to establish a new connection.</p>
