      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a diagram that shows the following different cloud deployment models. Community, these are clouds built to meet the needs of a specific industry, such as healthcare, government, or media, Community clouds can be private or public. Public, cloud-based applications and services offered in a public cloud are made available to the general population. Services may be free or are offered on a pay-per-use model, such as paying for online storage. The public cloud uses the Internet to provide services. Private, cloud-based applications and services offered in a private cloud are intended for a specific organization or entity, such as the government. A private cloud can be set up using the organization’s private network, though this can be expensive to build and maintain. A private cloud can also be managed by an outside organization with strict access security. Hybrid, a hybrid cloud is made up of two or more clouds (example: part Community, part public), where each part remains a distinctive object, but both are connected using a single architecture. Individuals on a hybrid cloud would be able to have degrees of access to various services based on user access rights.</div>
