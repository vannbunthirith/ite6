        <h1>VPN</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When connecting to the local network and sharing files, the communication between computers is not sent beyond that network. Data  remains secure because it is kept behind the router, off other networks, and off the Internet. To communicate and share resources over a network that is not secure, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is used.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A VPN is a private network that connects remote sites or users together over a public network, like the Internet. The most common type of VPN is used to access a corporate private network. The VPN uses dedicated secure connections, routed through the Internet, from the corporate private network to the remote user. When connected to the corporate private network, users become part of that network and have access to all services and resources as if they were physically connected to the corporate LAN. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Remote-access users must install the VPN client on their computers to form a secure connection with the corporate private network. The VPN client software encrypts data before sending it over the Internet to the VPN gateway at the corporate private network. VPN gateways establish, manage, and control VPN connections, also known as VPN tunnels. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To set up and configure a VPN connection, follow these steps in all Windows versions:</p>
          <p></p>

          <p>
