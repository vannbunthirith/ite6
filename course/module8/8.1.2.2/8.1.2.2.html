        <h1>Connecting the Router to the Internet</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A wireless router has several ports to connect wired devices. For example, the wireless router in Figure 1 has a USB port, an Internet port, and four Local Area Network (LAN) ports.  The <b>Internet</b> port is an Ethernet port that is used to connect the router to a service provider device such as a broadband DSL or cable modem. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The topology for connecting the devices is shown in Figure 2. The steps to connect a wireless router to a broadband modem port are as follows:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> On the router, connect a straight-through Ethernet cable to the port labeled <b>Internet</b>. This port might also be labeled <b>WAN</b>. The switching logic of the device forwards all the packets through this port when there is communication to and from the Internet and other connected computers. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> On the service provider broadband modem, connect the other end of the cable to the appropriate port. Typical labels for this port are <b>Ethernet</b>, <b>Internet</b>, or <b>WAN</b>.   </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> Turn on the broadband modem and plug in the power cord to the router. After the modem establishes a connection to the ISP, it will begin communicating with the router. The router Internet LEDs will light up, indicating communication. The modem enables the router to receive the network information necessary to gain access to the Internet from the ISP. This information includes public IP addresses, subnet mask, and DNS server addresses. </p>
