      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a table that lists the following common network problems and solutions. Identify the problem: NIC LED lights are not lit, probable causes: The network cable is unplugged, bad, or damaged, the NIC is damaged, possible solutions: Reconnect or replace the network connection to the computer, replace the NIC. Identify the problem: User cannot SSH into a remote device, probable causes: The remote device is not configured for SSH access, SSH is not allowed from the user or a particular network, possible solutions: Configure the remote device for SSH access, allow SSH access from the user or network. Identify the problem: Laptop cannot detect the wireless router, probable causes: The wireless router/access point is configured with a different 802.11 protocol, the SSID is not being broadcast, the wireless NIC in the laptop is disabled, possible solutions: Configure the wireless router with a compatible protocol for the laptop, configure the wireless router to broadcast the SSID, enable the wireless NIC in the laptop. Identify the problem: Computer has an IP address of 169.254.x.x, probable causes: The network cable is unplugged, the router is powered off or the connection is faulty, the NIC is damaged, possible solutions: Reconnect the network cable, ensure the router is powered on and is properly connected to the network, release and renew the IP address on the computer, replace the NIC. Identify the problem: Remote device does not respond to a ping request, probable causes: Windows firewall disables ping by default, the remote device is configured to not respond to ping requests, possible solutions: Set the firewall to enable the ping protocol, configure the remote device to respond to the ping request. Identify the problem: A user can access the local network but cannot access the internet, Probable causes: The gateway address is incorrect or not configured, the ISP is down, possible solutions: Ensure the correct gateway address is assigned to the NIC, call ISP to report outage. Identify the problem: The network is fully functional but the wireless device cannot connect to the network, probable causes: The wireless capability of the device is turned off, the device is out of wireless range, there is interference from other wireless devices using the same frequency range, possible solutions: Enable wireless capability of the device, move closer to the wireless router/access point, change wireless router to a different channel. Identify the problem: A windows computer, just connected to a network with only Windows computers, cannot view shared resources, probable causes: Workgroup name is Incorrect, network location is incorrect, Network Discovery and File Sharing is turned off, possible solutions: Change workgroup name, change to the correct network location, turn on Network Discovery and File Sharing. Identify the problem: A user cannot map a network drive, probable causes: User does not have appropriate permissions, incorrect workgroup, network Discovery and File Sharing is turned off, possible solutions: Configure appropriate permissions for this user, change workgroup name, turn on Network Discovery and File Sharing.</div>
