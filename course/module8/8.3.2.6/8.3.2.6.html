        <h1>Email Services</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Email requires several applications and services, as shown in the figure. Email is a store-and-forward method of sending, storing, and retrieving electronic messages across a network. Email messages are stored in databases on mail servers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Email clients communicate with mail servers to send and receive email. Mail servers communicate with other mail servers to transport messages from one domain to another. An email client does not communicate directly with another email client when sending email. Instead, both clients rely on the mail server to transport messages.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Email supports three separate protocols for operation: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), and Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP). The application layer process that sends mail uses SMTP. A client retrieves email using one of the two application layer protocols: POP or IMAP.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a topology that shows a sender connected to Router1, which is connected to the internet. A recipient is connected to Router2, which is also connected to the internet. The mail server for ISP A is connected to a router, which is connected to the internet. The mail server for ISP is connected to a router, which is connected to the internet. The recipient is sending an email message to, ‘recipient@cisco.com’. The email message is forwarded from the sender to the web server at ISP A using SMTP. The web server at ISP A then forwards the email message to the web server at ISP B using SMTP. The web server at ISP B then forwards the email message to the recipient using IMAP or POP3.</div>
