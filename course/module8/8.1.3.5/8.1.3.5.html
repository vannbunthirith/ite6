        <h1>Network Shares and Mapping Drives</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Network file sharing and mapping network drives is a secure and convenient way to provide easy access to network resources. This is especially true when different versions of Windows require access to network resources. Mapping a local drive is a useful way to access a single file, specific folders, or an entire drive between different operating systems over a network. Mapping a drive, which is done by assigning a letter (A to Z) to the resource on a remote drive, allows you to use the remote drive as if it was a local drive.</p>
          <p></p>

            <b>Network File Sharing</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>First determine which resources will be shared over the network and the type of permissions users will have to the resources. Permissions define the type of access a user has to a file or folder.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Read</b> - The user can view the file and subfolder names, navigate to subfolders, view data in files, and run program files.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Change</b> - In addition to Read permissions, the user can add files and subfolders, change the data in files, and delete subfolders and files.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Full Control</b> - In addition to Change and Read permissions, the user can change the permission of files and folders in an NTFS partition and take ownership of files and folders.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>To share the folder, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Right-click the folder <b>> Properties > Sharing > Advanced Sharing > </b>select <b>Share this folder > Permissions</b>. Identify who has access to the folder and which permissions. The figure shows the permissions window of a shared folder.</p>
