        <h1>DNS Services</h1>
        <div>
          <p>DNS is the method computers use to translate domain names into IP addresses. On the Internet, domain names, such as http://www.cisco.com, are much easier for people to remember than 198.133.219.25, which is the actual numeric IP address for this server. If Cisco decides to change the numeric IP address of www.cisco.com, it is transparent to the user because the domain name remains the same. The new address is simply linked to the existing domain name and connectivity is maintained.</p>
          <p>Figures 2 through 5 display the steps involved in DNS resolution.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is a topology that shows a client and a DNS server connected to a network. The address bar of the browser on the client is magnified to show the domain name, ‘http://www.cisco.com’. Figure 2 on this page is the same topology as figure 1. Because devices use numbers, the DNS server matches the domain name, ‘www.cisco.com’ with the numeric address, ‘198.133.219.25’. Figure 3 on this page is the same topology as figure 1. A DNS query for the domain name, ‘www.cisco.com’ is being sent by the client to the DNS server. Figure 4 on this page is the same topology as figure 1. A DNS response with the numeric address, ‘198.133.219.25’ for the domain name, ‘www.cisco.com’ is being sent to the client. The number is returned to the client for use in making requests of the server. Figure 5 on this page is the same topology as figure 1. A message is being sent by the client to the numeric address, ‘198.133.219.25’. A domain name is resolved to its numeric network device address by the DNS protocol.</div>
