        <h1>Identify the Problem</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Network problems can be simple or complex, and can result from a combination of hardware, software, and connectivity issues. Computer technicians must be able to analyze the problem and determine the cause of the error to repair the network issue. This process is called troubleshooting.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To assess the problem, determine how many computers on the network are experiencing the problem. If there is a problem with one computer on the network, start the troubleshooting process at that computer. If there is a problem with all computers on the network, start the troubleshooting process in the network room where all computers are connected. As a technician, you should develop a logical and consistent method for diagnosing network problems by eliminating one problem at a time.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Follow the steps outlined in this section to accurately identify, repair, and document the problem. The first step in the troubleshooting process is to identify the problem. The figure shows a list of open-ended and closed-ended questions to ask the customer.</p>

Open-ended questions: What problems are you experiencing with your computer or network device? What software has been installed on your computer recently? What were you doing when the problem was identified? What error messages have you received? What type of network connection is the computer using? Closed-ended questions: Has anyone else used your computer recently? Can you see any shared files or printers? Have you changed your password recently? Can you access the internet? Are you currently logged into the network? Is anyone else having this problem?</div>
