      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is an interactive activity that checks the learner’s understanding of the following ISP connection types. Cellular: The customer is a sales person who travels most of the time. A connection to the main office is required almost 24 hours a day. Satellite: The customer works from home, needs the fastest possible upload and download speeds to access the company’s FTP server, and lives in a very remote area where DSL and cable are not available. WiMax: The customer works downtown in a large city and requires a fast reliable connection that is not easily disrupted by large buildings. DSL: The customer can only receive television using satellite but lives in an area where high-speed internet access is available. Dial-up: The customer lives in a remote area deep in a valley and cannot afford broadband. Cable: The customer wants to bundle television, internet access, and phone all through the same company, but the local phone company does not offer all the services.</div>
