        <h1>Power Protection Devices</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To help shield against power fluctuation problems, use devices to protect the data and computer equipment:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Surge suppressor </b>- Helps protect against damage from surges and spikes. A surge suppressor diverts extra electrical voltage that is on the line to the ground. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)</b> - Helps protect against potential electrical power problems by supplying a consistent level of electrical power to a computer or other device. The battery is constantly recharging while the UPS is in use. The UPS provides a consistent quality of power when brownouts and blackouts occur. Many UPS devices can communicate directly with the computer operating system. This communication allows the UPS to safely shut down the computer and save data prior to the UPS losing all battery power. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Standby power supply (SPS)</b> - Helps protect against potential electrical power problems by providing a backup battery to supply power when the incoming voltage drops below the normal level. The battery is on standby during normal operation. When the voltage decreases, the battery provides DC power to a power inverter, which converts it to AC power for the computer. This device is not as reliable as a UPS because of the time it takes to switch over to the battery. If the switching device fails, the battery cannot supply power to the computer. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION</b>: UPS manufacturers suggest never plugging a laser printer into a UPS because the printer could overload the UPS.</p>
