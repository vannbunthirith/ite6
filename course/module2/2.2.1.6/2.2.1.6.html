            <b>Digital Multimeter</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A digital multimeter, as shown in Figure 1, is a device that can take many types of measurements. It tests the integrity of circuits and the quality of electricity in computer components. A digital multimeter displays the information on an LCD or LED screen.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Loopback Adapter</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A loopback adapter, as shown in Figure 2, also called a loopback plug, tests the basic functionality of computer ports. The adapter is specific to the port that you want to test. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Toner </b>
            <b>Generator and </b>
            <b>Probe</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The toner generator and probe, as shown in Figure 3, is a two-part tool. The toner part is connected to a cable at one end using specific adapters. The toner generates a tone that travels the length of the cable. The probe part traces the cable. When the probe is in near proximity to the cable to which the toner is attached, the tone can be heard through a speaker in the probe.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>WiFi Analyzer</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A Fluke WiFi Analyzer screen is shown in Figure 4. WiFi analyzers are mobile tools for auditing and troubleshooting wireless networks. Many WiFi analyzers are robust tools designed for enterprise network planning, security, compliance, and maintenance. But WiFi analyzers can also be used for smaller, wireless LANs. Technicians can see all available wireless networks in a given area, determine signal strengths, and position access points to adjust wireless coverage. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Some WiFi analyzers can help troubleshoot a wireless network by detecting misconfigurations, access point failures, and RFI problems.</p>
          <p></p>

            <b>External Hard Drive Enclosure</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Although an external hard drive enclosure, as shown in Figure 5, is not a diagnostic tool, it is often used when diagnosing and repairing computers. The customer hard drive is placed into the external enclosure for inspection, diagnosis, and repair using a known-working computer. Backups can also be recorded to a drive in an external enclosure to prevent data corruption during a computer repair.</p>

An external enclosure houses a hard drive that can be used to diagnose a customer hard drive or a computer that does not boot. The external enclosure can also be used to create backups of a customer’s hard drive.</div>
