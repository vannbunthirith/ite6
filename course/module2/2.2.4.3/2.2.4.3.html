        <h1>Hand Tools</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A technician needs to be able to properly use each tool in the toolkit. This page covers many of the various hand tools used when repairing computers.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Screws</b>
          </p>
          <p>Match each screw with the proper screwdriver. Place the tip of the screwdriver on the head of the screw. Turn the screwdriver clockwise to tighten the screw and counter clockwise to loosen the screw, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p>Screws can become stripped if you do not use the correct size and type of screwdriver. A stripped screw may not tighten firmly or it may not be easily removed. Discard stripped screws.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Flat Head Screwdriver</b>
          </p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 2, use a flat head screwdriver when you are working with a slotted screw. Do not use a flat head screwdriver to remove a Phillips head screw. Never use a screwdriver as a pry bar. If you cannot remove a component, check to see if there is a clip or latch that is securing the component in place.</p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION:</b> If excessive force is needed to remove or add a component, something is probably wrong. Take a second look to make sure that you have not missed a screw or a locking clip that is holding the component in place. Refer to the device manual or diagram for additional information.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Phillips Head Screwdriver</b>
          </p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 3, use a Phillips head screwdriver with crosshead screws. Do not use this type of screwdriver to puncture anything. This will damage the head of the screwdriver. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Hex Driver</b>
          </p>
          <p>Use a hex driver to loosen and tighten bolts that have a hexagonal (six-sided) head. Hex bolts should not be over-tightened because the threads of the bolts can be damaged. Do not use a hex driver that is too large for the bolt that you are using.</p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION:</b> Some tools are magnetized. When working around electronic devices, be sure that the tools you are using have not been magnetized. Magnetic fields can be harmful to data stored on magnetic media. Magnetic tools can also induce current, which can damage internal computer components. Test your tool by touching the tool with a screw. If the screw is attracted to the tool, do not use the tool.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Component Retrieving Tools</b>
          </p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 4, a parts retriever is used to place and retrieve parts that may be hard to reach with your fingers. Do not scratch or hit any components when using these tools. </p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION:</b> Pencils should not be used inside the computer to change the setting of switches. The pencil lead can act as a conductor and may damage the computer components.</p>
          <p>Various specialty tools, such as Torx bits, antistatic bags and gloves, and integrated circuit pullers, can be used to repair and maintain computers. Always avoid magnetized tools, such as screwdrivers with magnetic heads, or tools that use extension magnets to retrieve small metal objects that are out of reach. Additionally, there are specialized testing devices used to diagnose computer and cable problems:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Multimeter</b> - A device that measures AC/DC voltage, electric current, and other electrical characteristics, as shown in Figure 5. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Power supply tester</b> - A device that checks whether the computer power supply is working properly. A simple power supply tester might just have indicator lights, while more advanced versions show the amount of voltage and amperage. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Cable tester</b> - A device that checks for wiring shorts, faults, or wires connected to the wrong pins. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Loopback plug</b> - A device that connects to a computer, switch, or router port to perform a diagnostic procedure called a loopback test. In a loopback test, a signal is transmitted through a circuit and then returned to the sending device to test the integrity of the data transmission. </li>
            </ul>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is an animation showing proper screwdriver use. Clockwise to tighten a screw and counter clockwise to loosen a screw.Figure 2 on this page is an image showing a flat head screwdriver being used to work on a slotted screw. The image also shows a flat head screwdriver being used to work on a Phillips head screw. This part of the image is superimposed with a red circle with a red line through it.Figure 3 on this page is an image of a Phillips head screwdriver being used to work on a Phillips head screw.Figure 4 on this page is an image that shows a technician using a component retrieving tool. A component retrieving tool usually consists of a length of plastic tube of around 4 mm to 6 mm in diameter with a push-button on one end. Three metal wires protrude from the other end, each sprung to bend outwards, away from the tube's axis, but with their tips bent inwards to form teeth. The push-button drives the wires down the tube causing them to spread outwards, opening the teeth. When the button is released, an internal spring withdraws the wires which, constrained by the tube, are forced together, closing the teeth. By pressing the button, the user allows the teeth to open up and by releasing the button, the teeth will grab whatever object is below the tool.Figure 5 on this page is an interactive grahic showing a Fluke Networks 110 Multimeter. The activity allows the learner to understand the following various parts of a multimeter. Display: To view information displayed. Hold button: Display HOLD is enabled, display freezes the present reading. In MIN MAX AVG mode, the MIN MAX AVG recording is paused. MIN MAX AVG button: MIN MAX AVG mode is enabled, minimum, maximum, or average reading is displayed. Range button: the Meter selects the range with the best resolution, in manual range mode, the user selects the range. Hz button: Frequency from 50 Hz to 5 kHz. Notes: AC voltage and current AC-coupled, True RMS, up to 500 Hz. Dial options: Power Off; AC, alternating current, from 300 mV to 600 V; DC, direct current, from 1mV to 600 V; Beeper, turns on at less than 20 Ohms and turns off at greater than 250 Ohms; Ohms, from 0.1 Ohms to 40 Mega Ohms; Diodes, tests diodes, a result of 'OL' indicates that an open diode is present; Capacitance, from 1 nF (nanofarad) to 9999 µF (microfarad); COM terminal, Common (return) terminal for all measurements, when measuring voltages, this is often referred to as ground; Input Terminal, Input terminal for voltage, continuity, resistance, diode test, capacitance, and voltage frequency measurements.</div>
