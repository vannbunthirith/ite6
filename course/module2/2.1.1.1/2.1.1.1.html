        <h1>General Safety</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Safe working conditions help prevent injury to people and damage to computer equipment. A safe workspace is clean, organized, and properly lit. Everyone must understand and follow safety procedures. </p>
          <p>Follow safety guidelines to prevent cuts, burns, electrical shock, and damage to eyesight. As a best practice, make sure that a fire extinguisher and first-aid kit are available. Poorly placed or unsecured cables can cause tripping hazards in a network installation. Cable management techniques such as installation of cables in conduit or cable trays help to prevent hazards. </p>
          <p>This is a partial list of basic safety precautions to use when working on a computer:</p>
