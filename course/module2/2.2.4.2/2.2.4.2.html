        <h1>Antistatic Mat</h1>
        <div>
          <p>An antistatic mat is slightly conductive. It works by drawing static electricity away from a component and transferring it safely from equipment to a grounding point, as shown in the figure:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> Lay the mat on the workspace next to or under the computer case. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> Clip the mat to the case to provide a grounded surface on which you can place parts as you remove them from the system. </p>
          <p>When you are working at a workbench, ground the workbench and the antistatic floor mat. By standing on the mat and wearing the wrist strap, your body has the same charge as the equipment and reduces the probability of ESD. </p>
          <p>Reducing the potential for ESD reduces the likelihood of damage to delicate circuits or components.</p>
          <p>
            <b>NOTE</b>: Always handle components by the edges.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is an image of a computer case and components placed on top of an antistatic mat. Both ends of the antistatic mat’s cable are highlighted. One end of the cable is connected to the antistatic mat and the other end is connected to the computer case.</div>
