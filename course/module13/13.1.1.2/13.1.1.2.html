        <h1>Relationship Between Communication Skills and Professional Behavior</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Whether you are talking with a customer on the phone or in person, it is important to communicate well and to present yourself professionally. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If you are talking with a customer in person, that customer can see your body language. If you are talking with a customer over the phone, that customer can hear your tone and inflection. Customers can also sense whether you are smiling when you are speaking with them on the phone. Many call center technicians use a mirror at their desk to monitor their facial expressions. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Successful technicians control their own reactions and emotions from one customer call to the next. A good rule for all technicians to follow is that a new customer call means a fresh start. Never carry your frustration from one call to the next.</p>
