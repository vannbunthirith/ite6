        <h1>Level Two Technician Responsibilities</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As with level one technicians, call centers sometimes have different names for level two technicians. These technicians might be known as product specialists or technical-support personnel. The level two technician’s responsibilities are generally the same from one call center to the next.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The level two technician is usually more knowledgeable than the level one technician about technology or has been working for the company for a longer period of time. When a problem cannot be resolved within a predetermined amount of time, the level one technician prepares an escalated work order, as shown in the figure. The level two technician receives the escalated work order with the description of the problem and then calls the customer back to ask any additional questions and resolve the problem. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Level two technicians can also use remote access software to connect to the customer’s computer to update drivers and software, access the operating system, check the BIOS, and gather other diagnostic information to solve the problem.</p>
