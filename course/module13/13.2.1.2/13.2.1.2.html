        <h1>Legal Considerations in IT</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The laws in different countries and legal jurisdictions vary, but generally actions such as the following are considered to be illegal:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is not permissible to make any changes to system software or hardware configurations without customer permission. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is not permissible to access a customer’s or co-worker’s accounts, private files, or email messages without permission. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is not permissible to install, copy, or share digital content (including software, music, text, images, and video) in violation of copyright and software agreements or the applicable law. Copyright and trademark laws vary between states, countries and regions.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is not permissible to use a customer’s company IT resources for commercial purposes. </li>
            </ul>

          <p>
