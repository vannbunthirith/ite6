        <h1>Following Business Policies</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As a technician, you should be aware of all business policies related to customer calls. You would not want to make a promise to a customer that you cannot keep. Also have a good understanding of all rules governing employees.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Customer Call Rules</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These are examples of rules a call center might use to handle customer calls:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maximum time on call (example: 15 minutes) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maximum call time in queue (example: 3 minutes) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Number of calls per day (example: minimum of 30) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Passing calls on to other technicians (example: only when absolutely necessary and not without that technician’s permission) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>What you can and cannot promise the customer (see that customer’s SLA for details) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>When to follow the SLA and when to escalate to management </li>
