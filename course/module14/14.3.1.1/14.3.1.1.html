        <h1>Advanced Problems and Solutions for Networks</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Network problems can be attributed to hardware, software, or a combination of the two. You will resolve some types of problems more often than others, while other problems may require more in-depth troubleshooting skills.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Network Connection Problems</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These types of connection problems are often related to incorrect TCP/IP configurations, firewall settings, or devices that have stopped working, as shown in Figure 1. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Email Failure</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Not being able to send or receive email is often caused by incorrect email software settings, firewall settings, and hardware connectivity issues, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>FTP and Secure Internet Connection Problems</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>File transfer problems between FTP clients and servers are often caused by incorrect IP address and port settings, or security policies. Secure Internet connection problems are often related to incorrect certificate settings and ports blocked by software or hardware, as shown in Figure 3.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Problems Using Network Troubleshooting Tools</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unexpected information reported from CLI commands is often caused by incorrect IP address settings, hardware connection issues, and firewall settings, as shown in Figure 4. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is a table that lists the following advanced problems and solutions for network connections. Identify the Problem: A computer can connect to a network device by the IP address but not by the host name, Probable Causes: Incorrect host name, incorrect DNS settings, DNS server is not operational, Possible Solutions: Re-enter the host name, re-enter the IP address of the DNS server, restart the DNS server. Identify the Problem: The computer does not obtain or renew the IP address on the network, Probable Causes: The computer is using a static IP address from a different network, firewall is blocking DHCP, DHCP server is not operational, Wireless NIC is disabled, Possible Solutions: Enable the computer to obtain an IP address automatically, change the firewall settings to allow DHCP traffic, restart the DHCP server, enable Wireless NIC. Identify the Problem: An IP address conflict message displays when connecting a new computer to the network, Probable Causes: The same IP address is assigned to two devices on the network, another computer has been configured a static IP address that was already assigned by the DHCP server, Possible Solutions: Configure each device with an unique IP address, configure each device using the ipconfig /release and ipconfig /renew commands. Identify the Problem: A computer has network access but does not have Internet access, Probable Causes: The gateway IP address is incorrect, a router is configured incorrectly, DNS server is not operational, Possible Solutions: Reboot the modem, reboot the router, reconfigure the router settings, restart the DNS server. Identify the Problem: The computer automatically obtained the IP address 169.254.x.x, but cannot connect to the network, Probable Causes: The DHCP server is not operational, Possible Solutions: Restart the DHCP server. Identify the Problem: Users are experiencing slow transfer speeds, weak signal strength, intermittent connectivity on the wireless network, Probable Causes: Wireless security has not been implemented allowing unauthorised users access, there are too many users connected to the access point, user is too far away from access point, the wireless signal is experiencing interference from outside sources, Possible Solutions: Implement a wireless security plan, ensure the access point is centrally located, restart the access point, move the access point, turn off unneeded devices that are connected, add another access point or a repeater to strengthen the signal, upgrade the access point, change the channels on the wireless network.</div>
