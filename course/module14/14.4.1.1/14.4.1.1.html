        <div>
          <p>Security problems can be attributed to hardware, software, networks, or some combination of the three. You will resolve some types of security problems more often than others.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Malware Settings</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Malware protection problems are often related to incorrect software settings or configurations. As a result of these faulty settings, a computer may display one or more of the symptoms caused by malware and boot sector viruses, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>User Accounts and Permissions</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unauthorized access or blocked access is often caused by incorrect user account settings or incorrect permissions, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Computer Security</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Computer security problems can be caused by incorrect security settings in the BIOS or on the hard drive, as shown in Figure 3.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Firewall and Proxy Settings</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Blocked connections to networked resources and the Internet are often related to incorrect firewall and proxy rules, and incorrect port settings, as shown in Figure 4. </p>
