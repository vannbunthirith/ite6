        <h1>Twisted-Pair Wire Schemes</h1>
        <div>
          <p>There are two different patterns, or wiring schemes, called T568A and T568B. Each wiring scheme defines the pinout, or order of wire connections, on the end of the cable. The two schemes are similar except that two of the four pairs are reversed in the termination order, as shown in figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On a network installation, one of the two wiring schemes (T568A or T568B) should be chosen and followed. It is important that the same wiring scheme is used for every termination in that project. If working on an existing network, use the wiring scheme that already exists.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Using the T568A and T568B wiring schemes, two types of cables can be created: a straight-through cable and a crossover cable. A straight-through cable is the most common cable type. It maps a wire to the same pins on both ends of the cable. The order of connections (the pinout) for each color is the exact same on both ends.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Two devices directly connected and using different pins for transmit and receive are known as unlike devices. They require a straight-through cable to exchange data. For example, connecting a PC to a switch requires a straight-through cable.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A crossover cable uses both wiring schemes. T568A on one end of the cable and T568B on the other end of the same cable. Devices that are directly connected and use the same pins for transmit and receive, are known as like devices. They require the use of a crossover cable to exchange data. For example, connecting a PC to another PC requires a crossover cable.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: If the incorrect cable type is used, the connection between network devices will not function. However, many newer devices can automatically sense which pins are used for transmit and receive and will adjust their internal connections accordingly.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a diagram that shows the following T568A and T568B twisted-pair wiring schemes. T568A wire colours: wire 1, green with white stripe, wire 2, solid green, wire 3, orange with white stripe, wire 4, solid blue, wire 5, blue with white stripe, wire 6, solid orange, wire 7, brown with white stripe, wire 8, solid brown, T568a pairs:, pair 1, wire 4 and wire 5, pair 2, wire 3 and wire 6, pair 3, wire 1 and wire 2, pair 4, wire 7 and wire 8, T568b wire colours:, wire 1, orange with white stripe, wire 2, solid orange, wire 3, green with white stripe, wire 4, solid blue, wire 5, blue with white stripe, wire 6, solid green, wire 7, brown with white stripe, wire 8, solid brown, T568b pairs:, pair 1, wire 4 and wire 5, pair 2, wire 1 and wire 2, pair 3, wire 3 and wire 6, pair 4, wire 7 and wire 8. The figure also shows a table listing the following differences between a straight-through cable and a crossover cable. Cable: Ethernet Straight-through cable, Standard: Both ends T568A or both ends T568B, Application: Connects a network host to a network device such as a switch or hub. Cable: Ethernet Crossover cable, Standard: One end T568A and the other end T568B, Application: Connects two network hosts, connects two network intermediary devices (switch to switch or router to router).</div>
