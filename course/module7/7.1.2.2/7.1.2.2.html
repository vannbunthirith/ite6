        <h1>WLANs</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A Wireless LAN (WLAN) is a LAN that uses radio waves to transmit data between wireless devices. In a traditional LAN, devices are connected together using copper cabling. In some environments, installing copper cabling might not be practical, desirable, or even possible. In these situations, wireless devices are used to transmit and receive data using radio waves. As with LANs, on a WLAN, you can share resources, such as files, printers, and Internet access.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>WLANs can operate in two modes. In infrastructure mode, wireless clients connect to a wireless router or access point (AP). The AP in Figure 1 is connected to a switch, which provides access to the rest of the network and to the Internet. Access points are typically connected to the network using copper cabling. Instead of providing copper cabling to every network host, only the wireless access point is connected to the network with copper cabling. The range (radius of coverage) for typical WLAN systems varies from under 98.4 ft (30 m) indoors to much greater distances outdoors, depending on the technology used.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Ad hoc means the WLAN is created when it is needed. Ad hoc is usually temporary. Figure 2 shows an example ad hoc mode. The laptop is wirelessly connected to the smartphone, which has access to the Internet through cellular service provider.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is a topology that represents a Wireless LAN (WLAN) operating in infrastructure mode. The topology shows two laptops connected by wireless to an Access Point (AP). The AP is connected to Switch1. A desktop computer is also connected to Switch1. Switch1 is connected to Switch2. Switch2 is connected to a router which is connected to the Internet using a serial connection. Devices interconnect using the services of an AP or wireless router. Figure 2 on this page is a topology that represents Ad Hoc Mode. A laptop is connected wirelessly to a smart phone, which is connected to the Internet through cellular service provider.</div>
