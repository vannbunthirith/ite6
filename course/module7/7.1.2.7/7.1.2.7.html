        <h1>Client-Server Networks</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Servers have software installed that enables them to provide services, such as files, email, or web pages, to clients. Each service requires separate server software. For example, the server in Figures 1 and 2 requires file server software to provide clients with the ability to retrieve and store files. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In a client-server network, the client requests information or services from the server. The server provides the requested information or service to the client. Servers on a client-server network commonly perform some of the processing work for client machines. For example, a server can sort through a database before delivering the records requested by the client. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A single server can run multiple types of server software. In a home or small business, it may be necessary for one computer to act as a file server, a web server, and an email server.  A client computer can also run multiple types of client software. There must be client software for every service required. With multiple client software installed, a client can connect to multiple servers at the same time. For example, a user can check email and view a web page while instant messaging and listening to Internet radio.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In a client-server network, resources are controlled by a centralized network administration. The network administrator implements data backups and security measures. The network administrator also controls user access to the server resources.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is a topology that represents a client-server network showing a file server and client download example. The topology shows a smartphone, an IP phone, and a desktop computer labelled as ‘Client’ connected over a network to a server. Below the server are icons of three files. Above the network icon is an arrow labelled as, ‘Download’ pointing from the server to the connected devices. Files are downloaded from the server to the client. Resources are stored on the server. A client is a hardware/software combination that people use directly. Figure 2 on this page is a topology that represents a client-server network showing a file server and client upload example. The topology is the same as in figure 1 except that the arrow is below the network icon and is labelled as, ‘Upload’ pointing from the connected devices to the server. Files are uploaded from the client to the server for storage. Resources are stored on the server. A client is a hardware/software combination that people use directly.</div>
