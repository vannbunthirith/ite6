        <h1>Fiber-Optic Connectors</h1>
        <div>
          <p>An optical fiber connector terminates the end of an optical fiber. A variety of optical fiber connectors are available. The main differences among the types of connectors are dimensions and methods of coupling. Businesses decide on the types of connectors that will be used, based on their equipment.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click each connector in the figure to learn about the most popular types of fiber-optic connectors.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Because light can only travel in one direction over optical fiber, two fibers are required to support the full duplex operation. Therefore, fiber-optic patch cables bundle together two optical fiber cables and terminate them with a pair of standard single fiber connectors. Some fiber connectors accept both the transmitting and receiving fibers in a single connector known as a duplex connector, as shown in the Duplex Multimode LC Connector in the figure.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page shows images and descriptions of the following fiber-optic connectors: Straight-Tip (ST) Connectors, one of the first connector types used. The connector locks securely with a "twist-on/twist-off" bayonet style mechanism. Subscriber (SC) Connectors, sometimes referred to as square connector or standard connector. It is a widely adopted LAN and WAN connector that uses a push-pull mechanism to ensure positive insertion. This connector type is used with multimode and single-mode fiber. Lucent Connector (LC) Connectors, a smaller version of the fiber-optic SC connector. It is sometimes called a little or local connector and is quickly growing in popularity due to its smaller size. Duplex Multimode LC Connectors, similar to a LC simplex connector, but using a duplex connector.</div>
