        <h1>UDP</h1>
        <div>
          <p>UDP is similar to placing a regular, non-registered, letter in the mail. The sender of the letter is not aware of the availability of the receiver to receive the letter. Nor is the post office responsible for tracking the letter or informing the sender if the letter does not arrive at the final destination.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>UDP provides the basic functions for delivering data segments between the appropriate applications, with very little overhead and data checking. UDP is known as a best-effort delivery protocol. In the context of networking, best-effort delivery is referred to as unreliable because there is no acknowledgment that the data is received at the destination. </p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is an animation that shows how UDP segments are transmitted from sender to receiver as follows. Step 1: A file is sent to a server using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) application. UDP segments the data to be sent and sends all data, best-effort. Step 2: The file server receives all six segments, no acknowledgment is sent.</div>
