        <h1>Coaxial Cables</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A wide variety of networking cables are available, as shown in Figure 1. Coaxial and twisted-pair cables use electrical signals over copper to transmit data. Fiber-optic cables use light signals to transmit data. These cables differ in bandwidth, size, and cost. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Coaxial cable, shown in detail in Figure 2, is usually constructed of either copper or aluminum. It is used by both cable television companies and satellite communication systems.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Coaxial cable (or coax) carries data in the form of electrical signals. It provides improved shielding compared to unshielded twisted-pair (UTP), so it has a higher signal-to-noise ratio and can therefore carry more data. However, twisted-pair cabling has replaced coax in LANs because, when compared to UTP, coax is physically harder to install, more expensive, and harder to troubleshoot. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Coaxial cable is enclosed in a sheath or jacket and can be terminated with a variety of connectors, as shown in Figure 2. There are several types of coaxial cable:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Thicknet or 10BASE5</b> - Used in networks and operated at 10 Mb/s with a maximum length of 1640.4 ft. (500 m.) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Thinnet 10BASE2</b> - Used in networks and operated at 10 Mb/s with a maximum length of 607 ft. (185 m.) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>RG-59</b> - Most commonly used for cable television in the United States</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>RG-6</b> - Higher quality cable than RG-59, with more bandwidth and less susceptibility to interference</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Coaxial cable has no specific maximum bandwidth. The type of signaling technology used determines the speed and limiting factors.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page shows images of the following cables with stripped ends exposing their internal components: twisted-pair cable, coaxial cable, and fiber optic cable. Figure 2 on this page is a diagram that shows the perspective view and the front view of a coaxial cable highlighting the following layers: outer jacket, braided copper shielding, plastic insulation, and copper conductor. The figure also shows images of the following coaxial connectors: BNC, N type, and F type.</div>
