        <h1>MANs</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a network that spans across a large campus or a city. The network consists of various buildings interconnected through wireless or fiber optic backbones. The communication links and equipment are typically owned by a consortium of users, or by a network service provider who sells the service to the users. A MAN can act as a high-speed network to enable sharing of regional resources.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a topology that represents a metropolitan area network (MAN). The topology shows a group of buildings that are all interconnected to form a metropolitan area network (MAN). The image also shows that there are LANs in three of the buildings and that one of the buildings in the MAN is connected to another building that is not part of the MAN, forming a WAN.</div>
