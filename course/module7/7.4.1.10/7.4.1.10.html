        <h1>ICMP</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used by devices on a network to send control and error messages to computers and servers. There are several different uses for ICMP, such as announcing network errors, announcing network congestion, and troubleshooting.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Ping is commonly used to test connections between computers. Ping is a simple but highly useful command-line utility used to determine whether a specific IP address is accessible. To see a list of options that you can use with the ping command, type <b>ping /?</b> in the Command Prompt window, as shown Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Ping works by sending an ICMP echo request to a destination computer or other network device. The receiving device then sends back an ICMP echo reply message to confirm connectivity. Echo requests and echo replies are test messages that determine if devices can send packets to each other. With Windows, four ICMP echo requests (pings) are sent to the destination computer, as shown in Figure 2. If it is reachable, the destination computer responds with four ICMP echo replies. The percentage of successful replies can help you to determine the reliability and accessibility of the destination computer. Other ICMP messages report undelivered packets and whether a device is too busy to handle the packet. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You can also use ping to find the IP address of a host when that host’s name is known. If you ping the name of a website, for example, cisco.com, as shown in Figure 2, the IP address of the server is displayed.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is an image of the Command Line Interface (CLI) output for the ping /? command, listing the following options that you can use with the ping command:Option: “-t”, ping the specified host until stopped. To see statistics and continue – type Control-Break; to stop – type Control-C. Option: “-a”, resolve addresses to host names. Option: “-n count”, number of echo requests to send. “-1 size”, send buffer size. “-f”, set Don’t fragment flag in packet (IPv4-only). “-i TTL”, time to Live. “-v TOS”, Type of Service (IPV4-only. This setting has been deprecated and has no effect on the type of service field in the IP Header). “-r count”, record route for count hops (IPv4-only). “-s count”, timestamp for count hops (IPv4-only). “-j host-list”, loose source route along host-list (IPv4-only). “-k host-list”, strict source route along host-list (IPv4-only). “-w timeout”, timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply. “-R”, use routing header to test reverse route also (IPv6-only). “-S srcaddr”, source address to use. “-4”, Force using IPv4. “-6”, force using IPv6. Figure 2 on this page shows the CLI output for ping www.cisco.com</div>
