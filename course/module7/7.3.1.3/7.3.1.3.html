            <b>Wireless Access Points</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Wireless access points, shown in Figure 1, provide network access to wireless devices, such as laptops and tablets. The wireless access point uses radio waves to communicate with the wireless NIC in the devices and other wireless access points. An access point has a limited range of coverage. Large networks require several access points to provide adequate wireless coverage. A wireless access point provides connectivity only to the network, while a wireless router provides additional features.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Routers</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Routers connect networks, as shown in Figure 2. Switches use MAC addresses to forward traffic within a single network. Routers use IP addresses to forward traffic to other networks. A router can be a computer with special network software installed, or a device built by network equipment manufacturers. In larger networks, routers connect to switches, which then connect to LANs, like the router on the right in Figure 2. The router serves as the gateway to outside networks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The router on the left in Figure 2 is also known as a multipurpose device or integrated router. It includes a switch and a wireless access point. For some networks, it is more convenient to purchase and configure one device that serves all your needs than to purchase a separate device for each function. This is especially true for the home or small office. Multipurpose devices may also include a modem.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is a topology of a LAN. The topology shows three desktop computers, a server, a printer, and a wireless access point connected to a central switch. Three laptops are connected to the LAN via the wireless access point. Figure 2 on this page is a topology that shows two LANs connected over the Internet. The first LAN is a small office network with a printer, desktop computer, and an IP phone are connected to an integrated router by cable. A laptop, a tablet, and a smartphone are connected to the integrated router using wireless. The integrated router is connected to the Internet. The second LAN is a Data centre network with three servers connected to a switch. The switch is connected to a router. The router is connected to the internet.</div>
