PAN, a network that connects devices within the range of an individual person. All of these devices are dedicated to a single host. Peer-to-Peer, a network that has no hierarchy among the computers, nor has any dedicated servers. Each client has equivalent capabilities and responsibilities. LAN, a network that encompasses a small geographical area, typically owned by an individual or wholly managed by an IT department. MAN, a network that spans across a large campus or city and consists of various buildings interconnected through wireless or fiber optic backbones. WLAN, a network that uses radio waves to transmit data between wireless devices. The network can operate in infrastructure or ad hoc mode. WAN, a network that connects multiple networks that are in geographically separate locations and is owned by a service provider. Client Server, a network where a hosts request information or services from a server. The server provides the requested information or service to the hosts.</div>
