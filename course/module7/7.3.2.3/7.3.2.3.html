        <h1>Twisted-Pair Category Ratings</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Twisted-pair cables come in several categories (Cat). These categories are based on the number of wires in the cable and the number of twists in those wires. Most networks today are wired using twisted-pair cabling. The characteristics of twisted-pair cable are shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Cat 3 cables use a 6-pin RJ-11 connector, whereas all other twisted-pair cables use an 8-pin RJ-45 connector, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>New or renovated office buildings often have some type of UTP cabling that connects every office to a central point called the Main Distribution Facility (MDF). The distance limitation of UTP cabling used for data is 100 meters (330 feet). Cable runs in excess of this distance limitation need a switch, repeater, or hub to extend the connection to the MDF. These switches, repeaters, and hubs would be located in an IDF (Independent Distribution Facility).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cables that are installed inside plenum areas of buildings must be plenum rated. A plenum is any area that is used for ventilation, such as the area between the ceiling and a dropped ceiling. Plenum-rated cables are made from a special plastic that retards fire and produces less smoke than other cable types.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is a table listing the following characteristics of twisted-pair cable. Category: Cat 3 UTP, Speed: 10 Mb/s at 16 MHz, Features: Suitable for Ethernet LAN, most often used for phone lines. Category: Cat 5 UTP, Speed: 100 Mb/s at 100 MHz, Features: Manufactured with higher standard than Cat 3 to allow for higher data transfer rates. Category: Cat 5e UTP, Speed: 1000 Mb/s at 100 MHz, Features: Manufactured with higher standard than Cat 5 to allow for higher data transfer rates, more twists per foot than Cat 5 to better prevent EMI and RFI from outside sources. Category: Cat 6 UTP, Speed: 1000 Mb/s at 250 MHz. Category: Cat 6a UTP, Speed: 1000 Mb/s at 500 MHz. Category: Cat 7 ScTP, Speed: 10 Gb/s at 600 MHz, Features for Cat 6, 6a, and 7: Manufactured with higher standard than Cat 5e, more twists per foot than Cat 5e to better prevent EMI and RFI from outside sources, Cat 6a has better insulation and performance than Cat 6, may have a plastic divider to separate pairs of wires inside the cable to better prevent EMI and RFI, good choice for customers using applications that require large amounts of bandwidth, such as videoconferencing or gaming, ScTP (Screened Twisted-Pair) is very expensive and not as flexible as UTP. Figure 2 on this page is an image of an RJ-11 connector and an RJ-45 connector.</div>
