        <h1>Network Media</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Communication across a network is carried on a medium. The medium provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination. The plural for medium is media.</p>
          <p>Network devices are linked together using a variety of media.  As shown in Figure 1, these media are:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Copper cabling</b> - Uses electrical signals to transmit data between devices </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Fiber-optic cabling</b> - Uses glass or plastic fiber to carry information as light pulses </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Wireless connection</b> - Uses radio signals, infrared technology, or satellite transmissions</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The icons shown in Figure 2 are used throughout this course to represent the different types of network media. Local area network (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and wireless networks are discussed in the next topic. The Cloud will be used throughout this course to represent connections to the Internet. The Internet is often the medium for communications between one network and another network.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page shows the following images of network media. Copper, the first image shows two copper cables with their external casings stripped showing the individual strands in their different coloured casings, the second image shows different connectors used on copper cables. Fiber Optic, the first image shows a fiber optic cable with its external casing stripped showing the individual strands in their different coloured casings, the second image shows different connectors used on fiber optic cables. Wireless, the first image shows two different wireless routers, the second image shows a wireless webcam. Figure 2 on this page shows the following network media icons: LAN Media, a black connecting line. WAN Media, a red connecting line that looks like a lightning bolt. Wireless Media, a blue sine wave superimposed over a bold blue sine wave so that the peaks and troughs of the sine waves are offset. Network Cloud, a white cloud with a blue border and labelled as, ‘Internet’.</div>
