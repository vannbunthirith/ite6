        <h1>Fiber-Optic Cables</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Optical fiber is composed of two kinds of glass (core and cladding) and a protective outer shield (jacket). Click each component in the figure to learn more information.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Because it uses light to transmit signals, fiber-optic cable is not affected by EMI or RFI. All signals are converted to light pulses as they enter the cable, and converted back into electrical signals when they leave it. This means that fiber-optic cable can deliver signals that are clearer, can go farther, and have greater bandwidth than cable made of copper or other metals. Although the optical fiber is very thin and susceptible to sharp bends, the properties of the core and cladding make it very strong. Optical fiber is durable and is deployed in harsh environmental conditions in networks all around the world.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a diagram that shows the perspective view and the front view of a fibre-optic cable highlighting the following different layers. Jacket, typically a PVC jacket that protects the fiber against abrasion, moisture, and other contaminants. This outer jacket composition can vary depending on the cable usage. Strengthening Material, surrounds the buffer, prevents the fiber cable from being stretched when it is being pulled. The material used is often the same material used to produce bulletproof vests. Buffer, used to help shield the core and cladding from damage. Cladding, made from slightly different chemicals than those used to create the core. It tends to act like a mirror by reflecting light back into the core of the fiber. This keeps light in the core as it travels down the fiber. Core, the core is actually the light transmission element at the center of the optical fiber. This core is typically silica or glass. Light pulses travel through the fiber core.</div>
