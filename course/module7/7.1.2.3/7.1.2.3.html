        <h1>PANs</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A personal area network (PAN) is a network that connects devices, such as mice, keyboards, printers, smartphone, and tablets within the range of an individual person. All of these devices are dedicated to a single host and are most often connected with Bluetooth technology.</p>
          <p>Bluetooth is a wireless technology that enables devices to communicate over short distances. A Bluetooth device can connect up to seven other Bluetooth devices. Described in the IEEE standard 802.15.1, Bluetooth devices are capable of handling voice and data. Bluetooth devices operate in the 2.4 to 2.485 GHz radio frequency range, which is in the Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band. The Bluetooth standard incorporates Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH). AFH allows signals to "hop" around using different frequencies within the Bluetooth range, thereby reducing the chance of interference when multiple Bluetooth devices are present.</p>
