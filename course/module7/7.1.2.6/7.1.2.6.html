        <h1>Peer-to-Peer Networks</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In a peer-to-peer network, there is no hierarchy among the computers, nor are there any dedicated servers. Each device, also called a client, has equivalent capabilities and responsibilities. Individual users are responsible for their own resources and can decide which data and devices to share or install. Because individual users are responsible for the resources on their own computers, the network has no central point of control or administration. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Peer-to-peer networks work best in environments with ten or fewer computers. Peer-to-peer networks can also exist inside larger networks. Even on a large client network, users can still share resources directly with other users without using a network server. In your home, if you have more than one computer, you can set up a peer-to-peer network. You can share files with other computers, send messages between computers, and print documents to a shared printer, as shown in the figure.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Peer-to-peer networks have several disadvantages:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>There is no centralized network administration, which makes it difficult to determine who controls resources on the network. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>There is no centralized security. Each computer must use separate security measures for data protection. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The network becomes more complex and difficult to manage as the number of computers on the network increases. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>There might not be any centralized data storage. Separate data backups must be maintained. This responsibility falls on the individual users.</li>
            </ul>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a topology that represents a Peer-to-Peer Network. The topology shows a desktop computer labelled as, ‘Print client File server’ connected to a switch. A desktop computer labelled as, ‘Print server File client’ is also connected to the switch. A printer is directly connected to the print server file client. The Print client file server has a callout saying, “I have files on my hard drive that are being shared for Peer2. I also have a page that I need to print through Peer2.” The print server file client has a callout saying, “I need to access a file from the hard drive on Peer1. I also need to print a file that I received from Peer1, with a print request.”</div>
