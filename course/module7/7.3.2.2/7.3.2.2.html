        <h1>Twisted-Pair Cables</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Twisted-pair is a type of copper cabling used for telephone communications and most Ethernet networks. The pair is twisted to provide protection against crosstalk, which is the noise generated by adjacent pairs of wires in the cable. Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cabling is the most common variety of twisted-pair cabling. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 1, UTP cable consists of four pairs of color-coded wires that have been twisted together and then encased in a flexible plastic sheath that protects from minor physical damage. The twisting of wires helps protect against crosstalk. However, UTP does not protect against electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio frequency interference (RFI). EMI and RFI can be caused by a variety of sources including electric motors and fluorescent lights.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There is also a thin nylon cord within the cable which, when pulled backward along the length of the cable, will slice the jacket. This is the preferred method to access the wire pairs. It prevents nicking or cutting any of the wires in the cable.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Shielded twisted-pair (STP) was designed to provide better protection against EMI and RFI. As shown in Figure 2, each twisted-pair is wrapped in a foil shield. The four pairs are then wrapped together in a metallic braid or foil. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Both UTP and STP cables are terminated with an RJ-45 connector and plug into RJ-45 sockets, as shown in Figure 3. Compared to UTP cable, STP cable is significantly more expensive and difficult to install. To gain the full benefit of the shielding, STP cables are terminated with special shielded STP RJ-45 data connectors (not shown). If the cable is improperly grounded, the shield may act as an antenna and pick up unwanted signals.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is a diagram that shows the different pairs of copper wires in a twisted-pair cable. Each wire in a twisted pair is encased in colour-coded insulation and twisted together. The outer jacket of the cable protects the copper wire from physical damage. The colour-coded plastic insulation electrically isolates wires from each other and identifies each pair. Each twisted pair protects the signal from interference. Figure 2 on this page is a diagram that shows the following layers of a twisted-pair cable: jacket, braided or foil shield (protects all the twisted-pairs), foil shields (protects each set of twisted-pairs), and twisted-pairs. Figure 3 on this page shows an image of an RJ-45 UTP cable showing the RJ 45 connector. The figure also shows an image of 4 RJ-45 UTP sockets.</div>
