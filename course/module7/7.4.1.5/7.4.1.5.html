        <h1>Number of IPv6 Addresses</h1>
        <div>
          <p>IPv6 addressing will eventually replace IPv4 addressing. IPv6 overcomes the limitations of IPv4 and is a powerful enhancement with features that better suit current and foreseeable network demands. The 32-bit IPv4 address space provides approximately 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. IPv6 address space provides 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses, or 340 undecillion addresses, which is roughly equivalent to every grain of sand on Earth. The figure provides a visual to compare the IPv4 and IPv6 address space. </p>
