        <h1>IPv6 Address Formats</h1>
        <div>
          <p>IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and written as a string of hexadecimal values. Every 4 bits is represented by a single hexadecimal digit for a total of 32 hexadecimal values. The examples shown in Figure 1 are fully expanded IPv6 addresses. Two rules help reduce the number of digits needed to represent an IPv6 address.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Rule 1 - Omit Leading Os</b>
          </p>
          <p>The first rule to help reduce the notation of IPv6 addresses is to omit any leading 0s (zeros) in any 16-bit section. For example:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>01AB can be represented as 1AB</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>09F0 can be represented as 9F0</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>0A00 can be represented as A00</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>00AB can be represented as AB</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Rule 2 – Omit All 0 Segments</b>
          </p>
          <p>The second rule to help reduce the notation of IPv6 addresses is that a double colon (::) can replace any group of consecutive zeros. The double colon (::) can only be used once within an address, otherwise there would be more than one possible resulting address.</p>
          <p>Figures 2 to 4 show examples of how to use the two rules to compress the IPv6 addresses shown in Figure 1. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is a diagram that shows the following fully expanded IPv6 addresses: 2001:0DB8:0000:1111:0000:0000:0000:0200, FE80:0000:0000:0000:0123:4567:89AB:CDEF, FF02:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001.Figure 2 on this page is a diagram that demonstrates how to compress an IPv6 address by omitting leading zeros as follows: Fully expanded, 2001:0DB8:0000:1111:0000:0000:0000:0200. No leading zeroes, 2001:DB8:0:1111:0:0:0:200 Compressed, 2001:DB8:0:1111::200. Figure 3 on this page is a diagram that demonstrates how to compress an IPv6 address by omitting all zero segments as follows: Fully expanded, FE80:0000:0000:0000:0123:4567:89AB:CDEF. No leading zeroes, FE80:0:0:0:123:4567:89AB:CDEF Compressed, FE80::123:4567:89AB:CDEF.Figure 4 on this page is a diagram that demonstrates another example of how to compress an IPv6 address by omitting all zero segments as follows: Fully expanded, FF02:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001. No leading zeroes, FF02:0:0:0:0:0:1 Compressed, FF02::1.</div>
