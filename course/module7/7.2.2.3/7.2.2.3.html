        <h1>CSMA/CA</h1>
        <div>
          <p>IEEE 802.11 is the standard that specifies connectivity for wireless networks. Wireless networks use Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). CMSA/CA does not detect collisions but attempts to avoid them by waiting before transmitting. Each device that transmits includes in the frame the time duration that it needs for the transmission. All other wireless devices receive this information and know how long the medium will be unavailable, as shown in the figure. This means that wireless devices operate in half-duplex mode. The transmission efficiency of an AP or wireless router is reduced as more devices are attached.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a topology of the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) access control method. The topology shows three laptops connected to a central wireless router. One laptop has a callout that says, “I’m receiving this wireless frame.” The other two laptops have callouts that say, “I see in the wireless frame that the channel is going to be unavailable for a specific amount of time so I cannot send.”</div>
