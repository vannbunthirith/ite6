        <h1>Intermediary Devices</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Computer networks contain many devices that exist in between the host devices. These intermediary devices ensure that data flows from one host device to another host device. The most common intermediary devices are shown in the figure. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A switch is used to connect multiple devices to the network. A router is used to forward traffic between networks. A wireless router connects multiple wireless devices to the network. In addition, a wireless router often includes a switch so that multiple wired devices can connect to the network. An access point (AP) provides wireless connectivity, but has fewer features than a wireless router. A modem is used to connect a home or small office to the Internet. These devices will be discussed in more detail later in the chapter.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page shows the following intermediary device icons. Switch, a short, blue, 3-D box with a square top. On the top of the switch are two arrows pointing to the right and two arrows pointing to the left. Router, a short, blue, 3-D cylinder standing its round end. On the top of the router are four arrows in the shape of a cross. Two opposite arms of the cross are arrows pointing in to the center. The other two opposite arms of the cross are arrows pointing out from the center. Modem, a short, blue, 3-D box with a square top. On the front of the modem are five horizontal white dots. Access Point, a short, blue, 3-D box with a square top. On the front of the modem are two white sine waves. The peaks and troughs of the sine waves are offset. Wireless Router, the same as the router icon with two antennae extending upwards from the back of the icon.</div>
