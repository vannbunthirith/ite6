        <h1>TCP</h1>
        <div>
          <p>TCP transport is analogous to sending packages that are tracked from source to destination. If a shipping order is broken up into several packages, a customer can check online to see the order of the delivery.</p>
          <p>With TCP, there are three basic operations of reliability:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Numbering and tracking data segments transmitted to a specific device from a specific application</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Acknowledging received data</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Retransmitting any unacknowledged data after a certain period of time</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Click Play in the figure to see how TCP segments and acknowledgments are transmitted between sender and receiver.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is an animation that shows how TCP segments and acknowledgments are transmitted between sender and receiver as follows. Step 1: A file is sent to a server using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) application. TCP tracks the conversation and segments the data to be sent into six segments. Step 2: The first three out of six segments are forwarded to the server. Step 3: The file server acknowledges the first three segments received. Step 4: The client forwards the next three segments. Step 5: No segments are received, no acknowledgment is sent. Step 6: The client resends the final three segments. Step 7: The final three segments are received and acknowledged.</div>
