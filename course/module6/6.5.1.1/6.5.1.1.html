        <h1>Chapter 6: Microsoft Windows Operating System</h1>
        <div>
          <p>This chapter covered Windows configuration and management. As a technician, you should be skilled at installing, configuring, and troubleshooting an operating system. The following concepts from this chapter are important to remember:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Several different operating systems are available, and you must consider the customer’s needs and environment when choosing an OS.</p>
          <p>The main steps in setting up a customer’s computer include preparing the hard drive, installing the OS, creating user accounts, and configuring installation options.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A GUI shows icons of all files, folders, and applications on the computer. A pointing device, such as a mouse, is used to navigate in a GUI desktop.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A CLI uses commands to complete tasks and navigate the file system.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>With a virtual machine manager, system resources on a host computer can be allocated to run virtual machines. Virtual machines run operating systems, and using them can provide users with greater system functionality.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Preventive maintenance techniques help to ensure optimal performance of the OS. You should establish a backup strategy that allows for the recovery of data. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Some of the tools available for troubleshooting an OS problem include administrative tools, system tools, and CLI commands.</p>
