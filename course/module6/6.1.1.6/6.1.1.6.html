            <b>File Explorer and Windows Explorer</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>File Explorer is a file management application in Window 8. It allows you to navigate the file system and manage the folders, subfolders, and applications on your storage media. File Explorer is launched automatically when a folder or drive is opened. In File Explorer, common tasks, such as copying and moving files, and creating new folders, can be done using the Ribbon. The tabs at the top of the window change as different types of items are selected in the File Explorer. As shown in Figure 1, the Ribbon for the Home tab is displayed. If the Ribbon is not displaying, click the <b>Expand the Ribbon, </b>represented by a down arrow, at the upper-right corner of the window.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Windows Explorer is the name of the file management application in Windows 7 and earlier. Windows Explorer performs similar functions as File Explorer without the use of the Ribbon.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>This PC and Computer</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Windows 8.1, the This PC feature allows you to access the various drives installed in the computer. In Windows 7 and Vista, this same feature is called Computer.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Windows 8.1, the This PC feature can be accessed either through File Explorer or from the Start Screen. To open This PC via File Explorer, simply open File Explorer, and it should display This PC by default. To reach This PC via the Start Screen, start typing <b>This PC</b>. Click <b>This PC</b> when it appears among the search results in the right side of the screen. The search result is shown in Figure 2. This PC is shown in Figure 3.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Windows 8.0, 7, or Vista, click <b>Start</b> and select <b>Computer</b>. Figure 4 shows the Computer feature.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Opening Files</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You can open files in the same manner as applications. When opening a file, Windows determines which application is associated with the file type. For example, if you open a document, Windows will open the file with the associated program. This may be Microsoft Word, WordPad, Notepad, or another document-editing program.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Run as Administrator</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Modern operating systems use a number of methods to improve security. One of these methods is file permissions. Depending on the file permission, only users with enough permission can access the file. System files, other user files, or files with elevated permissions are examples of files that could deny a user access. To override this behavior and gain access to those files, you must open or execute them as the system administrator.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To open or execute a file using elevated permission, right-click the file and choose <b>Run as Administrator</b>. You will need to provide the password for the Administrator account.</p>
