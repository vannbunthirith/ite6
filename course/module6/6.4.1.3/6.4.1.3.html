        <h1>Test the Theory to Determine Cause</h1>
        <div>
          <p>After you have developed some theories about what is wrong, test your theories to determine the cause of the problem. The figure shows a list of quick procedures that can help determine the exact cause of the problem or even correct the problem. If a quick procedure does correct the problem, you can jump to verifying the full system functionality. If a quick procedure does not correct the problem, you need to research the problem further to establish the exact cause.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page lists step 3 in troubleshooting operating system problems, test the theory to determine cause. Common steps to determine cause: log in as a different user, use third party diagnostic software, determine if new software or software updates have just been installed, uninstall recently installed applications, boot into safe mode to determine if the problem is driver-related, roll back newly updated drivers, examine Device Manager for device conflicts, examine Event logs for warnings or errors, check the hard drive for errors and fix file system issues, use the system file checker to recover corrupt system files, use system restore if a system update or service pack has been installed</div>
