          <p>System Configuration (MSCONFIG) is a tool used to identify problems that keep Windows from starting correctly. To help with isolating the issue, services and startup programs can be turned off, and turned back on one at a time. After you have determined the cause, permanently remove or disable the program or service, or reinstall it.</p>
