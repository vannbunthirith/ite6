        <h1>System Utilities</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The Run Line utility, shown in Figure 1, allows you to enter commands to configure settings in Windows. Many of these commands are used for system diagnostics and modifications.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Because of the new GUI included in Windows 8, the Run Line utility lost much of its functionality. This is because Windows 8 allows a user to simply type commands at the Start Screen.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To access the Run Line utility in Windows, search for <b>Run</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This is a list of common commands:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>COMMAND </b>- This starts the Windows command line. It is used to execute command-line programs and utilities.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>DXDIAG </b>– This displays details for all DirectX components and drivers that are installed in a computer, as shown in Figure 2.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>

              <li>
                <b>MMC </b>– This opens the Microsoft Management console (MMC), shown in Figure 3, which allows you to organize management tools, called snap-ins, in one location for easy administration. You can also add web page links, tasks, ActiveX controls, and folders. You can create as many customized MMCs as needed, each with a different name. This is useful when multiple administrators manage different aspects of the same computer. Each administrator can have an individualized MMC for monitoring and configuring computer settings.</li>
            </ul>
