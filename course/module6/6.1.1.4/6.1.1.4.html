        <h1>Task Manager</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The Task Manager allows you to view all applications that are running and to close any application.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>After clicking <b>More details</b>, the Windows 8 Task Manager, shown in Figure 1, has the following tabs:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Processes </b>- This tab shows a list of processes currently running on the computer. A process is a set of instructions started by the user, a program, or the OS. Running processes are categorized as apps, background processes, or Windows system processes.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Performance </b>- This tab contains system performance graphs, as shown in Figure 2. You can select any of the options, CPU, Memory, Disk, or Ethernet, to see a performance graph in the right column.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>App History</b> - While the Processes tab shows live process information, this tab contains historical information, such as CPU time and network bandwidth. It is very useful when analyzing which apps consume the most resources.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Startup </b>- This tab shows what processes will be automatically started during Windows 8 startup. Windows 8 also measures the impact each process has in the system's overall startup time. To keep a process from starting automatically, right-click on the process and disable automatic startup.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Users </b>- This tab shows how much of the system resources each user is consuming. Expand a user to display all processes owned by that user.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Details </b>– This tab allows you to tweak the level of CPU priority for a given process. It is also possible to specify which CPU a process will use to run (CPU affinity). </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Services </b>- This tab displays all services currently running on the system and allows for stopping, starting and restarting them.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The Windows 7 and Vista Task Manager, shown in Figure 3, have the following tabs:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Applications </b>- This tab shows all running applications. From this tab you can create, switch to, or close an application that has stopped responding.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Processes</b> - This tab shows all running processes. From this tab, you can end processes or set process priorities.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Services </b>- This tab shows the available services, including their operational status.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Performance </b>- This tab shows the CPU and page file usage.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Networking </b>- This tab shows the usage of all network adapters.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Users </b>- This tab shows all users that are logged on the computer. From this tab, you can disconnect remote users or log off local users.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>To open the Task Manager, press <b>CTRL-ALT-DEL</b> and select <b>Start Task Manager.</b></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Alternatively, you can open the Task Manager by right-clicking the taskbar and selecting <b>Task Manager</b> in Windows 8 and <b>Start Task Manager</b> in Windows 7 and Vista.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Be careful when ending a process or changing the priority of processes. Ending a process causes the program to end immediately without saving any information. Ending a process might prevent the system from running correctly. Also, changing the priority of a process might adversely affect the performance of the computer.</p>
