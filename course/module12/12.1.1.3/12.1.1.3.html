        <h1>Phishing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Phishing is when a malicious party sends an email, calls on the phone, or places a text with the intent to trick the recipient into providing personal or financial information. Phishing attacks are also used to persuade users to unknowingly install malware on their devices. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, a user has received an email which looks like it originated from a legitimate outside organization, such as a bank. The attacker might ask for verification of information, such as a username, password, or PIN number, to possibly prevent some terrible consequence from occurring. If the user provides the requested information, the phishing attack is successful.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A form of phishing attack is called spear phishing. This is when a phishing attack is targeted at a specific individual or organization. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Organizations must educate their users regarding phishing attacks. There is rarely a need to provide sensitive personal or financial information online. Legitimate businesses will not ask for sensitive information through email. Be suspicious. When in doubt, make contact by mail or phone to ensure the validity of the request.</p>
