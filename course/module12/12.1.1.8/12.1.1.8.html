        <h1>Social Engineering</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Social engineering occurs when an attacker tries to gain access to equipment or a network by tricking people into providing the necessary access information. For example, in Figure 1, the social engineer gains the confidence of an employee and convinces the employee to divulge their username and password information.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The table in Figure 2 describes some social engineering techniques used to gain information.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Here are some basic precautions to help protect against social engineering:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Never give out your login credentials (e.g., username, password, PIN).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Never post credential information in your work area.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lock your computer when you leave your desk.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>To secure a physical location, the business should:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Implement an access or entry control roster listing who is permitted in.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not let anyone follow you through a door that requires an access card.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Always ask for the ID of unknown persons.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Restrict access to visitors.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Escort all visitors.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <button id="text-handle" title="Resize" role="button"></button>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page shows a social engineer sitting at a desktop computer saying to an employee, “Hi this is Amy from the help desk. We need to upgrade the software on your computer after work hours. What is your user ID and password? You can change the password tomorrow when you log in.” The employee sitting at a desktop computer replies, “OK, my ID and password are…”. Figure 2 on this page is a table that lists the following social engineering techniques: Pretexting, an attacker pretends to need personal or financial data in order to confirm the identity of the recipient. Phishing, an attacker sends a fraudulent email disguised as being from a legitimate, trusted source. The intention of this message is to trick the recipient into installing malware on their device, or to share personal or financial information. Spear phishing, an attacker creates a targeted phishing attack tailored for a specific individual or organization. Spam, attacker uses spam email to trick a user to click an infected link or download an infected file. Tailgating, an attacker quickly follows an authorised person into a secure location. The hacker then has access to a secure area. Something for Something (Quid pro quo), this is when a hacker requests personal information from a party in exchange for something like a free gift. Baiting, an attacker leaves a malware-infected physical device, such as a USB flash drive in a public location such as a corporate washroom. The finder finds the device and loads it into their computer, unintentionally installing the malware.</div>
