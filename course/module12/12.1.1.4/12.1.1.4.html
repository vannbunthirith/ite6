        <h1>Spam</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Spam, also known as junk mail, is unsolicited email. In most cases, spam is used as a method of advertising. However, spam can be used to send harmful links, malware, or deceptive content. The goal is to obtain sensitive information such as a social security number or bank account information. Most spam is sent out by multiple computers on networks that have been infected by a virus or worm. These compromised computers send out as much bulk email as possible.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Spam cannot be stopped, but its effects can be diminished. For example, most ISPs filter spam before it reaches the user’s inbox. Many antivirus and email software programs automatically perform email filtering, as shown in the figure. This means that they detect and remove spam from an email inbox. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Even with these security features implemented, some spam still might get through. Watch for some of the more common indicators of spam:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>An email has no subject line.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>An email is requesting an update to an account.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The email is filled with misspelled words or strange punctuation.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Links within the email are long and/or cryptic.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>An email is disguised as correspondence from a legitimate business.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The email requests that you open an attachment.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Organizations must also make employees aware of the dangers of opening email attachments that may contain a virus or a worm. Do not assume that email attachments are safe, even when they are sent from a trusted contact. The sender’s computer may be infected by a virus that is trying to spread itself. Always scan email attachments before opening them.</p>
