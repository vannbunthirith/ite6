        <h1>What is a Security Policy?</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A security policy is a set of security objectives that ensure the security of a network, the data, and the computer systems in an organization. The security policy is a constantly evolving document based on changes in technology, business, and employee requirements.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The security policy is usually created and managed by the organization management and the IT staff as illustrated in Figure 1. Together they create a document that should answer the questions listed in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A security policy typically includes the items described in Figure 3. This list is not exhaustive and could include other items related specifically to the operation of an organization.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In this course, we focus on configuring the Local Security Policy in Windows.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is an image that shows four people sitting at a table. One person has a callout that says, “The next item on the security policy that we need to discuss is the rules for network access.” Another person has a callout that says, “We must keep in mind that we have remote workers. They will have different access rules than our onsite employees.” Figure 2 on this page lists the following questions that a security policy should answer: Which assets require protection? What are the possible threats? What to do in the event of a security breach? What training will be in place to educate the end users? Figure 3 on this page lists the following items that are typically included in a security policy. Item: Identification and Authentication policies, Description: Specifies authorized persons that can have access to network resources and outlines verification procedures. Item: Password policies, Description: Ensures passwords meet minimum requirements and are changed regularly. Item: Acceptable Use policies, Description: Identifies network resources and usages that are acceptable to the organization. It may also identify ramifications if this policy is violated. Item: Remote Access policies, Description: Identifies how remote users can access a network and what is accessible via remote connectivity. Item: Network Maintenance policies, Description: Specifies network device operating systems and end user application update procedures. Item: Incident Handling policies, Description: Describes how security incidents are handled.</div>
