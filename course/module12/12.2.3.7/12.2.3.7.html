        <h1>Data Wiping</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Protecting data also includes removing files from storage devices when they are no longer needed. Simply deleting files or reformatting the drive may not be enough to ensure your privacy. For instance, deleting files from a hard disk drive does not remove them completely. The operating system only removes the reference to the file in the file allocation table. However, the data still remains on the drive. This data is not completely removed until the hard drive stores other data in the same location, overwriting the previous data. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For this reason, software tools can be used to recover folders, files, and even entire partitions. This could be a blessing if the erasure was accidental. But it could also be disastrous if the data is recovered by a malicious user.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For this reason, storage media should be fully erased using one or more of the following methods:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Data wiping</b>
                <b>software</b> - Also known as secure erase, consists of a software tool specifically designed to overwrite existing data multiple times, rendering the data unreadable. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Degaussing wand </b>– (Figure 1) Consists of a wand with very powerful magnets which is held over exposed hard drive platters to disrupt or eliminate the magnetic field on a hard drive.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Electromagnetic degaussing device</b>– Consists of a magnet with an electrical current applied to it to create a very strong magnetic field. The device can very quickly disrupt or eliminate the magnetic field on a hard drive.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>These methods are described in more detail in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: It is important to remember that data wiping and degaussing techniques are irreversible, and the data can never be recovered. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>SSDs are comprised of flash memory instead of magnetic platters. Common techniques used for erasing data such as degaussing are not effective. To fully ensure that data cannot be recovered from an SSD, perform a secure erase. This also applies to hybrid SSD.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Other storage media and documents (e.g., optical disks, eMMC, USB sticks) must also be destroyed. Use a shredding machine or incinerator that is designed to destroy documents and each type of media. For sensitive documents that must be kept, such as those with classified information or passwords, always keep them locked in a secure location.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When thinking about what devices must be wiped or destroyed, remember that devices besides computers and mobile devices store data. Printers and multifunction devices may also contain a hard drive that caches printed or scanned documents. This caching feature can be turned off in some instances, or the device needs to be wiped on a regular basis to ensure data privacy. It is a good security practice to set up user authentication on the device, if possible, to prevent an unauthorized person from changing any settings that concern privacy. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is an image that shows a degaussing wand being applied to the exposed hard drive platters. Figure 2 on this page is a table that lists the following methods for wiping data from a hard disk drive. Method: Data Wiping, Description: Useful when needing to occasionally wipe a drive, software tool takes a long time to erase a disk, tool may offer multiple data overwriting choices including using special patterns of ones and zeros, mathematical algorithms, and random bits, data wiping tools are available for free. Method: Degaussing Wand, Description: Useful when needing to occasionally wipe a drive, hard drive platters must be exposed to the wand for approximately two minutes, costs much less than an electromagnetic degaussing device. Method: Electromagnetic Degaussing Device, Description: Useful to bulk erase multiple drives, degaussing devices take very little time, for example,  10 seconds to wipeout a hard drive, a degaussing tool can be very expensive, for example US $20,000.</div>
