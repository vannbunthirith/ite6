        <h1>Data Backups</h1>
        <div>
          <p>You can make a Windows backup manually or schedule how often the backup takes place automatically. To successfully back up and restore data in Windows, the appropriate user rights and permissions are required.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>All users can back up their own files and folders. They can also back up files for which they have the Read permission. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>All users can restore files and folders for which they have the Write permission. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Members of the Administrators, Backup Operators, and Server Operators (if joined to a domain) can back up and restore all files, regardless of the assigned permissions. By default, members of these groups have the Backup Files and Directories and Restore Files and Directories user rights. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>To start the Windows 7 Backup Files wizard for the first time, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Control Panel > Backup and Restore > Set up backup</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To start the Windows Vista Backup Files wizard, use the following path: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Control Panel > Backup and Restore Center > Back up files</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Beginning with Windows 8, backup and restore became part of the File History utility, shown in Figure 1. In Windows 8.1 and 8.0, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Control Panel > File History > Turn on</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You will need to designate a backup location for File History. A network location or another internal or external physical drive can be used. Backing up data can take time, so it is preferable to do backups when computer and network utilization requirements are low. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Click the Advanced settings to change backup parameters, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
