        <h1>Hard Drive Recycling and Destruction</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Companies with sensitive data should always establish clear policies for storage media disposal. There are two choices available when a storage media is no longer needed. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The media can either be: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Recycled </b>- Hard drives that have been wiped can be reused in other computers. The drive can be reformatted and a new operating system installed. Two types of formatting can be performed as described in Figure 1.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Destroyed </b>- Destroying the hard drive fully ensures that data cannot be recovered from a hard drive. Specifically designed devices such as hard drive crushers, hard drive shredders, incinerators, and more can be used for large volumes of drives. Otherwise physically damaging the drive with hammer such, as shown in Figure 2, is effective. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A company may choose an outside contractor to destroy their storage media. These contractors are typically bonded and follow strict governmental regulations. They may also offer a certificate of destruction. This certificate provides evidence that the media has been completely destroyed.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is a table that lists the following data wiping methods. Method: Standard Format, Description: Also called high-level formatting, a boot sector is created and a file system is set up on the disk. A standard format can only be performed after a low-level format has been completed. Method: Low-Level Format, Description: The surface of the disk is marked with sector markers to indicate where data will be stored physically on the disk, and tracks are created, low-level formatting is most often performed at the factory after the hard drive is built. Figure 2 on this page is an image of a hard drive being physically destroyed by using a hammer.</div>
