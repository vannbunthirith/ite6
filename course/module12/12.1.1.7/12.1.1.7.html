        <h1>Zero-Day Attacks</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A zero-day attack, sometimes referred to as a zero-day threat, is a computer attack that tries to exploit software vulnerabilities that are unknown or undisclosed by the software vendor. The term zero-hour describes the moment when the exploit is discovered. During the time it takes the software vendor to develop and release a patch, the network is vulnerable to these exploits, as shown in the figure. Defending against these fast-moving attacks requires network security professionals to adopt a more sophisticated view of the network architecture. It is no longer possible to contain intrusions at a few points in the network.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a diagram that demonstrates the Microsoft zero-day vulnerability. The diagram shows a horizontal timeline. The first entry at the left end of the timeline says, “Day 0: Zero-day malware in the wild.” The next entry, which is at the center of the timeline says, “Day 16: First antivirus signature deployed.” The next entry to the right says, “Day 17: Second antivirus signature deployed.” The last entry at the right of the timeline says, “Day 18: Third antivirus signature deployed.” Day 16 to Day 18 are labelled as, “Traditional response.” Below day 17 is a label that says, “Security advisory issued.” Below day 18 is a label that says, “Microsoft IE patched.”</div>
