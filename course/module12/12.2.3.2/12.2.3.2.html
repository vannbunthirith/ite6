          <p>Additional methods of securing access to devices include:</p>

                <b>Biometric Security</b> – (Figure 1) Biometric security compares physical characteristics against stored profiles to authenticate people. A profile is a data file containing known characteristics of an individual. The user is granted access if their characteristics match saved settings. A fingerprint reader is a common biometric device. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Smart Card Security - </b>(Figure 2) A smart card is a small plastic card, about the size of a credit card, with a small chip embedded in it. The chip is an intelligent data carrier, capable of processing, storing, and safeguarding data. Smart cards store private information, such as bank account numbers, personal identification, medical records, and digital signatures. Smart cards provide authentication and encryption to keep data safe.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Security Key Fob – </b>(Figure 3) A security key fob is a device that is small enough to attach to a key ring. It uses a process called two-factor authentication, which is more secure than a username and password combination. First, the user enters a personal identification number (PIN). If correctly entered, the security key fob will display a number. This is the second factor which the user must enter to login to the device or network. </li>
