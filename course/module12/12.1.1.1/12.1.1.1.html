        <h1>Malware</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Computers and the data contained on them must be secured against malware:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Malware is any software created to perform malicious acts. The word malware is an abbreviation of <b>mal</b>icious soft<b>ware</b>.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is usually installed on a computer without the knowledge of the user. These programs open extra windows on the computer or change the computer configuration. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Malware is capable of modifying web browsers to open specific web pages that are not the desired web page. This is known as browser redirection. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>It is also capable of collecting information stored on the computer without the user’s consent.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The first and most common type of malware is a computer <i>virus</i>. A virus is transferred to another computer through email, USB drives, file transfers, and even instant messaging. The virus hides by attaching itself to computer code, software, or documents on the computer. When the file is accessed, the virus executes and infects the computer. Examples of what a virus can do are listed in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Another type of malware is a <i>Trojan horse</i>. A Trojan horse usually looks like a useful program but it carries malicious code. For example, Trojan horses are often provided with free online games. These games are downloaded to the user computer but also contain a Trojan horse. While playing the game, the Trojan horse is installed on the user's system and continues operating even after the game has been closed. There are several types of Trojan horses as described in the table in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Over the years, malware has continued to evolve. The table in Figure 3 describes other types of malware.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To detect, disable, and remove malware before it infects a computer, always use antivirus software, antispyware, and adware removal tools. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It is important to know that these software programs become outdated quickly. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the technician to apply the most recent updates, patches, and virus definitions as part of a regular maintenance schedule. Many organizations establish a written security policy stating that employees are not permitted to install any software that is not provided by the company. </p>

      <iframe id="media" title="interactive graphic" aria-label="interactive graphic" aria-describedby="media-description"></iframe>
      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page lists the following actions viruses can take: Alter, corrupt, delete files or even erase an entire hard drive on a computer, prevent the computer from booting, cause applications to not load or operate correctly, use the users email account to spread the virus to other computers, lay dormant until summoned by the attacker, record keystrokes to capture sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers and send that data to the attacker. Figure 2 on this page is a table that lists the following types of Trojan horses. Type of Trojan Horse: Remote-access, Description: Trojan enables unauthorised remote access. Type of Trojan Horse: Data-sending, Description: Trojan provides the attacker with sensitive data, such as passwords. Type of Trojan Horse: Destructive, Description: Trojan corrupts or deletes files. Type of Trojan Horse: Proxy, Description: Trojan will use the victim’s computer as a source device to launch attacks and perform other illegal activities. Type of Trojan Horse: FTP, Description: Trojan enables unauthorised file transfer services on end devices. Type of Trojan Horse: Security software disabler, Description: Trojan stops antivirus programs or firewalls from functioning. Type of Trojan Horse: Denial of Service (DoS), Description: Trojan slows or halts network activity. Figure3 on this page is a table that lists the following varieties of malware. Security Mode: Worms, Description: A worm is a self-replicating program that is harmful to networks with the intent to slow or disrupt network operations, worms typically spread automatically by exploiting known vulnerabilities in legitimate software. Security Mode: Adware, Description: Usually distributed by downloading online software, it displays advertising on your computer most often as in a pop-up window, adware pop-up windows are sometimes difficult to control and open new windows faster than users can close them. Security Mode: Spyware, Description: Similar to adware but used to gather information about a user and send the information to another entity, without the user’s consent, spyware can be low threat, gathering browsing data, or it can be high threat where personal or financial information is gathered. Security Mode: Ransomware, Description: Similar to adware but denies access to the infected computer system, the ransomware then demands a paid ransom for the restriction to be removed. Security Mode: Rootkits, Description: Program used by hackers to gain Administrator-account level access to a computer, very difficult to detect because it can control security programs to conceal itself, special rootkit removal software can be used but sometimes a re-installation of the operating system is necessary to ensure that the rootkit is completely removed.</div>
