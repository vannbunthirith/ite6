          <p>New RAM may be needed when an application locks up or the computer displays frequent error messages. To determine if the problem is the RAM, execute the RAM test in the BIOS. If the test is not available, special RAM testing programs are available to download. Another method is to replace the old RAM module with a known good module. Restart the computer to see if the computer runs without error messages.</p>

          <p>When selecting new RAM, you must ensure that it is compatible with the current motherboard. Also, the speed of the new RAM must be supported by the chipset. It may be helpful to take the original memory module with you when you shop for the replacement RAM.</p>
          <p>Memory may also be categorized as unbuffered or buffered:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Unbuffered memory</b> – This is regular memory for computers. The computer reads data directly from the memory banks making it faster than buffered memory. However, there is a limit on the amount of RAM that can be installed. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Buffered memory</b> – This is specialized memory for servers and high-end workstations that use a large amount of RAM. These memory chips have a control chip built into the module. The control chip assists the memory controller in managing large quantities of RAM. Avoid buffered RAM for a gaming computer and the average workstation because the extra controller chip reduces RAM speed.</li>
