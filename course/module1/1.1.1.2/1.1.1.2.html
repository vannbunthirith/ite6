        <h1>Power Supplies</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Electricity from wall outlets is provided in alternating current (AC). However, all components inside a computer require direct current (DC) power. To obtain DC power, computers use a power supply, as shown in Figure 1, to convert AC power into a lower voltage DC power. </p>
          <p>The following describes the various computer desktop power supply form factors that have evolved over time:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Advanced Technology (AT)</b> – This is the original power supply for legacy computer systems now considered obsolete.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>AT Extended (ATX)</b> – This is the updated version of the AT but still considered to be obsolete.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>ATX12V</b> – This is the most common power supply on the market today. It includes a second motherboard connector to provide dedicated power to the CPU. There are several versions of ATX12V available.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>EPS12V</b> – This was originally designed for network servers but is now commonly used in high-end desktop models.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>A power supply includes several different connectors, as shown in Figure 2. These connectors are used to power various internal components such as the motherboard and disk drives. The connectors are “keyed” which means that they are designed to be inserted in only one orientation. The table in Figure 3 describes common power supply connectors. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The different connectors also provide different voltages. The most common voltages supplied are 3.3 volts, 5 volts, and 12 volts. The 3.3 volt and 5 volt supplies are typically used by digital circuits, while the 12 volt supply is used to run motors in disk drives and fans. The table in Figure 4 highlights the different voltages provided by a power supply. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Power supplies can also be single rail, dual rail, or multi rail. A rail is the printed circuit board (PCB) inside the power supply to which the external cables are connected. A single rail has all of the connectors connected to the same PCB while a multi rail PCB has separate PCBs for each connector. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A computer can tolerate slight fluctuations in power, but a significant deviation can cause the power supply to fail.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page shows a standard computer power supply unit. Figure 2 on this page shows the following 6 images. A 20-pin or 24-pin slotted connector. A SATA keyed connector. A Molex keyed connector. A Berg keyed connector. A 4-pin to 8-pin auxiliary power connector. A 6/8-pin PCIe power connector Figure 3 on this page shows a table listing the following descriptions of the common power supply connectors. Connector: 20-pin or 24-pin slotted connector, Description: Connects to the motherboard, the 24-pin connector has two rows of 12 pins each, the 20-pin connector has two rows of 10 pins each. Connector: SATA keyed connector, Description: Connects disk drives, connector is wider and thinner than a Molex connector. Connector: Molex keyed connector, Description: Connects hard drives, optical derives, or other devices. Connector: Berg keyed connector, Description: Connect to legacy floppy drives, smaller than a Molex connector. Connector: 4-pin to 8-pin auxiliary power connector, Description: Connector has two rows of two to four pins and supplies power to different areas of the motherboard, the auxiliary power connector is the same shape as the main power connector but smaller. Connector: 6/8-pin PCIe power connector, Description: Connector has two rows of three to four pins and supplies power to internal components. Figure 4 on this page is a table listing the following voltages and other information for each connector found on the power supply. Voltage: +12V, Wire Colour: Yellow, Use: Disk drive, motors, fans, cooling devices, and the system bus slots, Power Supply Form: AT, ATX, ATX12V. Voltage: -12V, Wire Colour: Blue, Use: Some type of serial port circuits and early programmable read-only memory (PROM), Power Supply Form: AT, ATX, ATX12V. Voltage: +3.3V, Wire Colour: Orange, Use: Most newer CPUs, some type of system memory, and AGP video cards, Power Supply Form: ATX, ATX12V. Voltage: +5V, Wire Colour: Red, Use: Motherboard, Baby AT, earlier CPUs, and motherboard components, Power Supply Form: AT, ATX, ATX12V. Voltage: -5V, Wire Colour: White, Use: ISA bus cards and early PROMS, Power Supply Form: AT, ATX, ATX12V. Voltage: 0V, Wire Colour: Black, Use: Ground - Used to complete circuits with other voltages, Power Supply Form: AT, ATX, ATX12V</div>
