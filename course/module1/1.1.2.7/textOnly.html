          <p>Early computers had RAM installed on the motherboard as individual chips. The individual memory chips, called dual inline package (DIP) chips, were difficult to install and often became loose. To solve this problem, designers soldered the memory chips to a circuit board to create a memory module which would then be placed into a memory slot on the motherboard. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The different types of memory modules are described in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Memory modules can be single-sided or double-sided. Single-sided memory modules contain RAM on only one side of the module. Double-sided memory modules contain RAM on both sides.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The speed of memory has a direct impact on how much data a processor can process in a given period of time. As processor speed increases, memory speed must also increase. Memory throughput has also been increased through multichannel technology. Standard RAM is single channel, meaning that all of the RAM slots are addressed at the same time. Dual channel RAM adds a second channel to be able to access a second module at the same time. Triple channel technology provides another channel so that three modules can be accessed at the same time.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The fastest memory is typically static RAM (SRAM) which is cache memory for storing the most recently used data and instructions by the CPU. SRAM provides the processor with faster access to the data than retrieving it from the slower dynamic RAM (DRAM), or main memory. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The three most common types of cache memory are described in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Memory errors occur when the data is not stored correctly in the chips. The computer uses different methods to detect and correct data errors in memory. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Different types of error checking methods are described in Figure 3.</p>
