        <h1>Memory Modules</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Early computers had RAM installed on the motherboard as individual chips. The individual memory chips, called dual inline package (DIP) chips, were difficult to install and often became loose. To solve this problem, designers soldered the memory chips to a circuit board to create a memory module which would then be placed into a memory slot on the motherboard. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The different types of memory modules are described in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Memory modules can be single-sided or double-sided. Single-sided memory modules contain RAM on only one side of the module. Double-sided memory modules contain RAM on both sides.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The speed of memory has a direct impact on how much data a processor can process in a given period of time. As processor speed increases, memory speed must also increase. Memory throughput has also been increased through multichannel technology. Standard RAM is single channel, meaning that all of the RAM slots are addressed at the same time. Dual channel RAM adds a second channel to be able to access a second module at the same time. Triple channel technology provides another channel so that three modules can be accessed at the same time.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The fastest memory is typically static RAM (SRAM) which is cache memory for storing the most recently used data and instructions by the CPU. SRAM provides the processor with faster access to the data than retrieving it from the slower dynamic RAM (DRAM), or main memory. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The three most common types of cache memory are described in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Memory errors occur when the data is not stored correctly in the chips. The computer uses different methods to detect and correct data errors in memory. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Different types of error checking methods are described in Figure 3.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is an interactive graphic that explains the difference between the following types of memory modules. Name: DIP, Description: Dual Inline Package is an individual memory chip. A DIP has dual rows of pins used to attach it to the motherboard. Name: SIMM, Description: Single Inline Memory Module is a small circuit board that holds several memory chips. SIMMs have 30-pin or 72-pin configurations. Name: DIMM Memory, Description: Dual Inline Memory Module is a circuit board that holds SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, DDR2 SDRAM, and DDR3 SDRAM chips. There are 168-pin SDRAM DIMMs, 184-pin DDR DIMMs, and 240-pin DDR2 and DDR3 DIMMs. Name: SODIMM, Description: Small Outline DIMM has a 72-pin and 100-pin configurations for support of 32-bit transfers or a 144-pin, 200-pin, and 204-pin configurations for support of 64-bit transfers. This smaller, more condensed version of DIMM provides random access data storage that is ideal for use in laptops, printers, and other devices where conserving space is desirable. Figure 2 on this page is an interactive graphic that explains the difference between the following common types of cache memory. Name: L1, Description: L1 cache is internal cache and is integrated into the CPU. Name: L2, Description: L2 cache is external cache and was originally mounted on the motherboard near the CPU. L2 cache is now integrated into the CPU. Name: L3, Description: L3 cache is used on some high-end workstations and server CPUs. Figure 3 on this page is an interactive graphic that explains the difference between the following types of error checking. Name: Nonparity, Description: Nonparity memory does not check for errors in memory. Name: Parity, Description: Parity memory contains eight bits for data and one bit for error checking. The error-checking bit is called a parity bit. Name: ECC, Description: Error Correction Code memory can detect multiple bit errors in memory and correct single bit errors in memory.</div>
