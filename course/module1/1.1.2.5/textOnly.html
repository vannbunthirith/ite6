          <p>A computer has different types of memory chips. However, all memory chips store data in the form of bytes. A byte is a grouping of digital information and represents information such as letters, numbers, and symbols. Specifically, a byte is a block of eight bits stored as either 0 or 1 in the memory chip.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An essential computer chip is the read-only memory (ROM) chip. ROM chips are located on the motherboard and other circuit boards and contain instructions that can be directly accessed by a CPU. The instructions stored in ROM include basic operation instructions such as booting the computer and loading the operating system. </p>

          <p>Figures 1 through 4 give details about the different types of ROM memory.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It is important to note that ROM chips retain their contents even when the computer is powered down. The contents cannot be erased or changed easily. </p>

            <b>Note</b>: ROM is sometimes called firmware. This is misleading, because firmware is actually the software that is stored in a ROM chip.</p>
