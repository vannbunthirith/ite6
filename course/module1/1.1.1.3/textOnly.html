          <p>Power supply specifications are typically expressed in watts (W). To understand what a watt is, refer to the table in Figure 1 which describes the four basic units of electricity that a computer technician must know.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A basic equation, known as Ohm's Law, expresses how voltage is equal to the current multiplied by the resistance: <b>V = IR</b>. In an electrical system, power is equal to the voltage multiplied by the current: <b>P = VI</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Computers normally use power supplies ranging from 250W to 800W output capacity. However, some computers need 1200W and higher capacity power supplies. When building a computer, select a power supply with sufficient wattage to power all components. Each component inside the computer uses a certain amount of power. Obtain the wattage information from the manufacturer’s documentation. When deciding on a power supply, make sure to choose one that has more than enough power for the current components. A power supply with a higher wattage rating has more capacity; therefore, it can handle more devices.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On the back of some power supplies is a small switch called the voltage selector switch, as shown in Figure 2. This switch sets the input voltage to the power supply to either 110V / 115V or 220V / 230V. A power supply with this switch is called a dual voltage power supply. The correct voltage setting is determined by the country where the power supply is used. Setting the voltage switch to the incorrect input voltage could damage the power supply and other parts of your computer. If a power supply does not have this switch, it automatically detects and sets the correct voltage.</p>

            <b>CAUTION</b>: Do not open a power supply. Electronic capacitors located inside of a power supply, shown in Figure 3, can hold a charge for extended periods of time.</p>
