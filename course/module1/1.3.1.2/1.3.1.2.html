        <h1>CAx Workstations</h1>
        <div>
          <p>One example of a specialized computer is a workstation used to run computer-aided design (CAD) or computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A CAD or CAM (CAx) workstation, as shown in the figure, is used to design products and control the manufacturing process. CAx workstations are used to create blueprints, design homes, cars, airplanes, computers, and many of the parts in the products that you use every day. A computer used to run CAx software must support the needs of the software and the I/O devices that the user needs to design and manufacture products. CAx software is often complex and requires robust hardware. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Consider the following hardware when you need to run CAx software:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Powerful processor</b> - CAx software must make enormous amounts of calculations very quickly. It should perform fast rendering of 2D and 3D graphics. Fast, multicore processors are recommended in CAD workstations. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>High-end video card</b> – These high resolution graphic cards perform fast rendering of 2D and 3D graphics using specialized GPU. Multiple monitors are desired, or even required, so that the user can work with code, 2D renderings, and 3D models all at the same time. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>RAM</b> - Because of the high amount of data processed by a CAx workstation, RAM is very important. The more RAM that is installed, the more data the processor can calculate before needing to read from slower hard drives. Install the maximum amount memory supported by the motherboard and the operating system. The quantity and speed of the memory should exceed the minimums recommended by the CAx application.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
