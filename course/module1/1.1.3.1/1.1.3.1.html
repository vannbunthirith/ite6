        <h1>Video Ports and Cables</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A video port connects a monitor to a computer using a cable. Video ports and monitor cables transfer analog signals, digital signals, or both. Computers are digital devices that create digital signals. The digital signals are sent to the graphics card where they are transmitted through a cable to a digital display. Digital signals can also be converted to analog signals by the graphics card and transferred to an analog display. Lower image quality is a result of converting a digital signal to an analog signal. A display and a monitor cable that support digital signals will provide higher image quality than those supporting only analog signals. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are several video ports and connector types: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Digital Visual Interface (DVI)</b> - (Figure 1) The DVI connector is usually white and consists of 24 pins (three rows of eight pins) for digital signals, 4 pins for analog signals, and a flat pin called a ground bar. Specifically, DVI-D handles digital signals only, while DVI-A handles only analog signals.  DVI uses a dual-link interface which creates two groups of data channels that can carry more than 10 Gb/s of digital video information. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>DisplayPort connector</b>– (Figure 2) DisplayPort is an interface technology that is designed to connect high-end graphics-capable PCs and displays, as well as home theater equipment and displays. The connector consists of 20 pins and can be used for audio, video, or both. DisplayPort supports video data rates up to 8.64 Gb/s. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Mini DisplayPort</b> - A smaller version of the DisplayPort connector is called a Mini DisplayPort. It is used in Thunderbolt 1 and Thunderbolt 2 implementations.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>HDMI</b> - High Definition Multimedia Interface was developed specifically for high-definition televisions. However, its digital features also make it a good candidate for computers.  There are two common types of HDMI cables. Full size HDMI Type A cable is the standard cable used to connect audio and video devices. Mini-HDMI Type C is used to connect laptops and portable devices such as tablets. The Type C connector shown in Figure 3 is smaller than the Type A connector and has 19 pins.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Thunderbolt</b> – (Figure 4) Thunderbolt 1 and Thunderbolt 2 use the Mini DisplayPort (MDP) adapter, while Thunderbolt 3 requires a USB-C connector. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>VGA connector</b> – (Figure 5) This is a connector for analog video. It has 3 rows and 15 pins. It is also sometimes referred to as the DE-15 or HD-15 connector.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>RCA connectors</b> – (Figure 6) RCA connectors have a central plug with a ring around it and are used to carry audio or video. RCA connectors are often found in groups of three, where a yellow connector carries video and a pair of red and white connectors carries left and right audio channels.  </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>BNC connector</b> - (Figure 7) BNCs connect coaxial cables to devices using a quarter-turn connection scheme. BNC is used with digital or analog audio, or video.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Din-6 </b>– This connector has 6 pins and is commonly used for analog audio, video, and power in security camera applications.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Wireless</b> – These typically have additional transmitters to be connected to an external monitor / TV.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Legacy monitor connection methods include composite / RGB or S-Video.</p>
