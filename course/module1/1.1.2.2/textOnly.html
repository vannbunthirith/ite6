          <p>While the motherboard is considered to be the backbone of the computer, the central processing unit (CPU) is considered to be the brain. In terms of computing power, the CPU, sometimes referred to as the processor, is the most important element of a computer system. Most calculations take place in the CPU.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>CPUs come in different form factors, each style requiring a particular slot or socket on the motherboard. Common CPU manufacturers include Intel and AMD.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The CPU socket or slot is the connection between the motherboard and the processor. Modern CPU sockets and processors are built around the following architectures:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Pin Grid Array (PGA)</b> - (Figure 1) In PGA architecture, the pins are on the underside of the processor which is inserted into the motherboard CPU socket using zero insertion force (ZIF). ZIF refers to the amount of force needed to install a CPU into the motherboard socket or slot.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Land Grid Array (LGA)</b> - (Figure 2) In an LGA architecture, the pins are in the socket instead of on the processor. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>A program is a sequence of stored instructions. A CPU executes these instructions by following a specific instruction set. </p>
          <p>There are two distinct types of instructions sets that CPUs may use:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)</b> - This architecture uses a relatively small set of instructions. RISC chips are designed to execute these instructions very rapidly. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)</b> - This architecture uses a broad set of instructions, resulting in fewer steps per operation. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>While the CPU is executing one step of the program, the remaining instructions and the data are stored nearby in a special, high-speed memory, called cache.</p>
