              <li>A personal computer system consists of hardware components and software applications.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The computer case and power supply must be chosen carefully to support the hardware inside the case and allow for the addition of components.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The internal components of a computer are selected for specific features and functions. All internal components must be compatible with the motherboard.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the correct type of ports and cables when connecting devices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Typical input devices include the keyboard, mouse, touch screen, and digital cameras.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Typical output devices include monitors, printers, and speakers.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cases, power supplies, the CPU and cooling system, RAM, hard drives, and adapter cards, must be upgraded when devices fail or no longer meet customer needs.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Specialized computers require hardware specific to their function. The type of hardware used in specialized computers is determined by how a customer works and what a customer wants to accomplish.</p>
