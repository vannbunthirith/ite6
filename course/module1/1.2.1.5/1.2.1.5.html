        <h1>Select the CPU and CPU Cooling System</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Before you buy a CPU, make sure that it is compatible with the existing motherboard. Manufacturers’ websites are a good resource to investigate the compatibility between CPUs and other devices. The table in Figure 1 lists the various sockets available and their supported processors.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When upgrading the CPU, make sure the correct voltage is maintained. A Voltage Regulator Module (VRM) is integrated into the motherboard. You can configure the CPU voltage settings in the BIOS or UEFI software. The speed of a modern processor is measured in GHz. A maximum speed rating refers to the maximum speed at which a processor can function without errors. Two primary factors can limit the speed of a processor:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The processor chip is a collection of transistors interconnected by wires. Transmitting data through the transistors and wires creates delays.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>As the transistors change state from on to off or off to on, a small amount of heat is generated. The amount of heat generated increases as the speed of the processor increases. When the processor becomes too hot, it begins to produce errors.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The front-side bus (FSB) is the path between the CPU and the Northbridge. It is used to connect various components, such as the chipset and expansion cards, and RAM. Data can travel in both directions across the FSB. The frequency of the bus is measured in MHz. The frequency at which a CPU operates is determined by applying a clock multiplier to the FSB speed. For example, a processor running at 3200 MHz might be using a 400 MHz FSB. 3200 MHz divided by 400 MHz is 8, so the CPU is eight times faster than the FSB. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Processors are further classified as 32-bit and 64-bit. The primary difference is the number of instructions that can be handled by the processor at one time. A 64-bit processor processes more instructions per clock cycle than a 32-bit processor. A 64-bit processor can also support more memory. To utilize the 64-bit processor capabilities, ensure that the operating system and applications installed support a 64-bit processor.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The CPU is one of the most expensive and sensitive components in the computer case. The CPU can become very hot; therefore most CPUs require a heat sink, combined with a fan for cooling. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 list several factors to consider when choosing a CPU cooling system.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page shows two tables. The first table lists the following various Intel sockets and their supported processor architecture. Intel Socket: 775, Architecture: Land Grid Array (LGA). Intel Socket: 1155, Architecture: LGA. Intel Socket: 1156, Architecture: LGA. Intel Socket: 1150, Architecture: LGA. Intel Socket: 1366, Architecture: LGA. Intel Socket: 2011, Architecture: LGA. The second table lists the following various AMD sockets and their supported processors. AMD Socket: AM3, Architecture: Pin Grid Array (PGA). AMD Socket: AM3+, Architecture: PGA. AMD Socket: FM1, Architecture: PGA. AMD Socket: FM2, Architecture: PGA. AMD Socket: FM2+, Architecture: PGA. Figure 2 on this page is a table listing several factors and considerations affecting the choice of a CPU cooling system. Socket type: The heat sink or fan type must match the socket type of the motherboard. Motherboard physical specifications: The heat sink or fan must not interfere with any components attached to the motherboard. Case size: The heat sink or fan must fit within the case. Physical environment: The heat sink or fan must be able to disperse enough heat to keep the CPU cool in warm environments.</div>
