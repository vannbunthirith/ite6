        <h1>Select a Media Reader</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A media reader is a device that reads and writes to different types of media cards, for example, those found in a digital camera, smart phone, or MP3 player. When replacing a media reader, ensure that it supports the type and storage capacity of cards that will be used.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Factors to consider when purchasing a media reader are listed on Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Choose the correct media reader based on your customer’s current and future needs. For example, if a customer needs to use multiple types of media cards, a multiple format media reader is needed. These are some common media cards, as shown in Figure 2:</p>
