        <h1>RAM</h1>
        <div>
          <p>RAM is the temporary working storage for data and programs that are being accessed by the CPU. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are different types of RAM that can be used by a computer. The figure gives details about them.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unlike ROM, RAM is volatile memory, which means that the contents are erased every time the computer is powered off. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: ROM is nonvolatile which means that the contents are not erased when the computer is powered off.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Adding more RAM in a computer enhances the system performance. For instance, more RAM increases the memory capacity of the computer to hold and process programs and files. With less RAM, a computer must swap data between RAM and the much slower hard drive. The maximum amount of RAM that can be installed is limited by the motherboard.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The interactive figure on this page explains the difference between the following types of RAM. Name: DRAM, Description: Dynamic RAM is a memory chip that is used as main memory. DRAM must be constantly refreshed with pulses of electricity in order to maintain the data stored within the chip. Name: SRAM, Description: Static RAM is a memory chip that is used as cache memory. SRAM is much faster than DRAM and does not have to be refreshed as often. SRAM is much more expensive than DRAM. Name: SDRAM, Description: Synchronous DRAM is DRAM that operates in synchronization with the memory bus. The memory bus is the data path between the CPU and the main memory. Control signals are used to coordinate the exchange of data between SDRAM and the CPU. Name: DDR, Description: Double Data Rate SDRAM is memory that transfers data twice as fast as SDRAM. DDR SDRAM increases performance by transferring data twice per clock cycle. Name: DDR2, Description: Double Data Rate 2 SDRAM is faster than DDR-SDRAM memory. DDR2 SDRAM improves performance over DDR SDRAM by decreasing noise and crosstalk between the signal wires. Name: DDR3, Description: Double Data Rate 3 SDRAM expands memory bandwidth by doubling the clock rate of DDR2 SDRAM. DDR3 SDRAM consumes less power and generates less heat than DDR2 SDRAM. Name: DDR4, Description: Double Data Rate 4 SDRAM quadruples DDR3 maximum storage capacity, requires 40% less power due to it using a lower voltage and has advanced error correction features.</div>
