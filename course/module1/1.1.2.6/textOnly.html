          <p>RAM is the temporary working storage for data and programs that are being accessed by the CPU. </p>

          <p>There are different types of RAM that can be used by a computer. The figure gives details about them.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Unlike ROM, RAM is volatile memory, which means that the contents are erased every time the computer is powered off. </p>

            <b>Note</b>: ROM is nonvolatile which means that the contents are not erased when the computer is powered off.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Adding more RAM in a computer enhances the system performance. For instance, more RAM increases the memory capacity of the computer to hold and process programs and files. With less RAM, a computer must swap data between RAM and the much slower hard drive. The maximum amount of RAM that can be installed is limited by the motherboard.</p>
