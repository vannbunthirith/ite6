        <h1>Adapter Cards and Expansion Slots</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Adapter cards increase the functionality of a computer by adding controllers for specific devices or by replacing malfunctioning ports. </p>
          <p>There are a variety of adapter cards available that are used to expand and customize the capability of a computer:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Sound adapter</b> - Sound adapters provide audio capability.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Network Interface Card (NIC)</b> - A NIC connects a computer to a network using a network cable.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Wireless NIC</b> - A wireless NIC connects a computer to a network using radio frequencies.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Video adapter</b> – Video adapters provide video capability.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Capture card</b> - Capture cards send a video signal to a computer so that the signal can be recorded to the computer hard drive with Video Capture software.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>TV tuner card </b>- These provide the ability to watch and record television signals on a PC by connecting a cable television, satellite, or antenna to the installed tuner card.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Universal Serial Bus (USB) port </b>- USB ports connect a computer to peripheral devices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Thunderbolt card</b> - These connect a computer to peripheral devices. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Redundant array of independent disks (RAID)</b> - A RAID adapter connects to multiple hard disk drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs), making them work as one logical unit. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows some of these adapter cards. It should be noted that some of these adapter cards can be integrated on the motherboard.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Older computers may also have a modem adapter, Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP), a Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) adapter, and more.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Computers have expansion slots on the motherboard to install adapter cards. The type of adapter card connector must match the expansion slot. Refer to Figure 2 to learn about expansion slots.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page shows images of the following four adapter cards. A Sound Adapter, a Network Interface Card (NIC), a Redundant Array of Independent Disks adapter (RAID), a Video Adapter. Figure 2 on this page is an interactive graphic that explains the difference between the following types of expansion slots. Name: PCI, Description: Peripheral Component Interconnect is a 32-bit or 64-bit expansion slot. It is currently found in many computers. It is found on most motherboards. Name: Mini PCI, Description: This is smaller version of PCI for laptops. Mini PCI has three different form factors; Type I, Type II, and Type III. Name: PCI-X, Description: PCI eXtended is an updated version of the standard PCI.  It uses a 32-bit bus with higher bandwidth than the PCI bus. PCI-X can operate up to four times faster than PCI. Name: PCIe, Description: PCI Express uses a serial bus that has higher throughput and many other improvements over the older expansion slots. PCIe has x1, x4, x8, and x16 slots which vary in length from shortest to longest, respectively. Shown here are the two most common sizes, x1 at the top and x16 at the bottom.</div>
