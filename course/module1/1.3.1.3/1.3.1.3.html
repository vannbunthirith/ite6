        <h1>Audio and Video Editing Workstations</h1>
        <div>
          <p>An audio editing workstation is used to record music, create music CDs, and CD labels. A video editing workstation can be used to create television commercials, prime-time programming, and movies for the theater, or home movies. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Specialized hardware and software are combined to build a computer to perform audio and video editing. Audio software on an audio editing workstation, shown in the figure, is used to record audio, manipulate how the audio sounds through mixing and special effects, and finalize recordings for publication. Video software is used to cut, copy, combine, and change video clips. Special effects are also added to video using video software. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Consider the following hardware when you need to run audio and video editing software:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Specialized audio card</b> - When recording music to a computer in a studio, multiple inputs from microphones and many outputs to effects equipment may be needed. An audio card capable of handling all these inputs and outputs is needed. Research different audio card manufacturers and understand the needs of your customer to install an audio card that will meet all the needs of a modern recording or mastering studio.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Specialized video card</b> - A video card that can handle high resolutions and multiple displays is necessary to combine and edit different video feeds and special effects in real time. You must understand the needs of the customer and research video cards to install a card that can handle the large amounts of information that come from modern cameras and effects equipment.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Large, fast hard drives</b> - Modern video cameras record in high resolution at fast frame rates. This translates into a large amount of data. Small hard drives will fill up very quickly, and slow hard drives will not be able to keep up with demands, even dropping frames at times. A large, fast hard drive such as SSD or SSHD drives are recommended to record high-end video without errors or missed frames. RAID levels such as 0 or 5, where striping is used, can help to increase read or write speeds.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Dual monitors</b> - When working with audio and video, two, three, or even more monitors can be very helpful to keep track of everything that is going on with multiple tracks, scenes, equipment, and software. HDMI, DisplayPort, and Thunderbolt cards are recommended while DVI is acceptable. If multiple monitors are required, specialized video cards are necessary when building an audio or video workstation.</li>
