          <p>There are many connection standards in use today. Many are interoperable but require specialized components. These components are called adapters and converters:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Adapter</b> – This is a component that physically connects one technology to another. For example, a DVI to HDMI adapter. The adapter could be one component or a cable with different ends.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Converter</b> – This performs the same function as an adapter but also translates the signals from one technology to the other. For example, a USB 3.0 to SATA converter enables a hard disk drive to be used as a flash drive.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>There are many types of adapters and converters available:</p>

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>USB A to USB B adapter</b> – This adapter is used to connect a USB A port to a USB B port.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>USB to Ethernet adapter</b> – (Figure 2) This adapter is used to connect a USB port to an Ethernet connector.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>

                <b>USB to PS/2 adapter</b> – (Figure 3) This adapter is used to connect a USB keyboard or mouse to a PS/2 port.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>HDMI to VGA converter</b> – The converter translates the VGA output signal of a PC to an HDMI output signal so that an HDMI monitor can be used.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Thunderbolt to DVI converter</b> – The converter translates the Thunderbolt mini DisplayPort video signal to a DVI video signal so that a DVI monitor can be used. </li>
            </ul>
