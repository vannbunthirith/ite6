        <h1>Enhancing CPU Operation</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Various CPU manufacturers complement their CPU with performance enhancing features. For instance, Intel incorporates Hyper-Threading to enhance the performance of some of their CPUs. With Hyper-Threading, multiple pieces of code (threads) are executed simultaneously in the CPU. To an operating system, a single CPU with Hyper-Threading performs as though there are two CPUs when multiple threads are being processed. AMD processors use HyperTransport to enhance CPU performance. HyperTransport is a high-speed connection between the CPU and the Northbridge chip. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The power of a CPU is measured by the speed and the amount of data that it can process. The speed of a CPU is rated in cycles per second, such as millions of cycles per second, called megahertz (MHz), or billions of cycles per second, called gigahertz (GHz). The amount of data that a CPU can process at one time depends on the size of the front side bus (FSB). This is also called the CPU bus or the processor data bus. Higher performance can be achieved when the width of the FSB increases. The width of the FSB is measured in bits. A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer. Current processors use a 32-bit or 64-bit FSB.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Overclocking is a technique used to make a processor work at a faster speed than its original specification. Overclocking is not a recommended way to improve computer performance and can result in damage to the CPU. The opposite of overclocking is CPU throttling. CPU throttling is a technique used when the processor runs at less than the rated speed to conserve power or produce less heat. Throttling is commonly used on laptops and other mobile devices.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The latest processor technology has resulted in CPU manufacturers finding ways to incorporate more than one CPU core into a single chip. Multicore processors have two or more processors on the same integrated circuit. The table in the figure describes the various types of multicore processors.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Integrating the processors on the same chip creates a very fast connection between them. Multicore processors execute instructions more quickly than single-core processors. Instructions can be distributed to all the processors at the same time. RAM is shared between the processors because the cores reside on the same chip. A multicore processor is recommended for applications such as video editing, gaming, and photo manipulation.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>High-power consumption creates more heat in the computer case. Multicore processors conserve power and produce less heat than multiple single-core processors, thus increasing performance and efficiency.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>CPUs have also been enhanced through the use of the NX bit, also called the execute disable bit. This feature, when supported and enabled in the operating system, is able to protect areas of memory that contain operating system files from malicious attacks by malware.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a table listing the following descriptions for multicore processors. Number of Cores: Single core CPU, Description: One core inside a single CPU that handles all the processing. A motherboard may have sockets for more than one single processor, providing the ability to build a powerful, multiprocessor compute. Number of Cores: Dual core CPU, Description: Two cores inside a single CPU in which both cores can process information at the same time. Number of Cores: Triple core CPU, Description: Three cores inside a single CPU. This is a quad core processor with one of the cores disabled. Number of Cores: Quad core CPU, Description: Four cores inside a single CPU. Number of Cores: Hexa-core CPU, Description: Six cores inside a single CPU. Number of Cores: Octa-core CPU, Description: Eight cores inside a single CPU.</div>
