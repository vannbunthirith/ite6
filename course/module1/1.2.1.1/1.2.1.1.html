        <h1>Building a Computer</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When upgrading or building a new computer, several factors must be considered. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before making any purchases, determine what the purpose of the computer will be. What do you want to do with the computer? Are you buying or building a new home system for the family? Are you building a workstation for a client in an architectural firm who needs to run graphic-intensive applications such as AutoCAD? Or are you building a gaming machine that will give you an edge over competitors?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The next question is how many and what types of external devices will be connected to the computer? Do you require a RAID system? Does the client require older or proprietary components to be connected? Do you need to install a powerful graphics card?</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The purpose of the computer and the types of external components initially influences the selection of the motherboard. The motherboard must accommodate the desired CPU and CPU cooling solution, the type and amount of RAM, and the types and number of expansion slots and ports. </p>

What is it going to be used for? What type of components do I want to connect to it? How much money do I have to spend?</div>
