          <p>An input device enters data or instructions into a computer. </p>
          <p>The following are examples of input devices:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Mice and Keyboards</b> – (Figure 1) These are the two most commonly used input devices. The keyboard is used to enter text while the mouse is used to navigate the graphical user interface (GUI). Laptops also have touchpads to provide built-in mouse features.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Touch Screens</b> – (Figure 2) These input devices have touch or pressure sensitive screens. The computer receives instructions specific to the place on the screen that the user touches. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Joysticks and Gamepads</b> – (Figure 3) These are input devices for playing games. Gamepads allow the player to control movement and views with small sticks and multiple buttons. Many gamepads also have triggers that register the amount of pressure the player puts on them. Joysticks are often used to play flight simulation-style games.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Digital Cameras and Digital Video</b>
                <b>Cameras</b> – (Figure 4) These input devices capture images that can be stored, displayed, printed, or altered. Stand-alone or integrated webcams capture images in real time.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Scanners</b> – (Figure 5) These devices digitize an image or document. The digitization of the image is stored as a file that can be displayed, printed, or altered. A bar code reader is a type of scanner that reads Universal Product Code (UPC) bar codes. It is widely used for pricing and inventory information.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Digitizers</b> – (Figure 6) This device allows a designer or artist to create blueprints, images, or other artwork by using a pen-like tool called a stylus on a surface that senses where the stylus tip is touching it. Some digitizers have more than one surface, or sensor, and allow the user to create 3D models by performing actions with the stylus in mid-air.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Biometric Identification Devices</b> – (Figure 7) These input devices identify a user based on a unique physical feature such as their fingerprints or voice. Many laptops now have fingerprint readers to automate logging in to the device.  </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Smart Card Readers</b> – These input devices are typically used on a computer to authenticate the user. A smart card may be the size of a credit card with an embedded microprocessor that is typically under a gold contact pad on one side of the card. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>A keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) switch is a hardware device that can be used to control more than one computer while using a single keyboard, monitor, and mouse. For businesses, KVM switches provide cost-efficient access to multiple servers. Home users can save space using a KVM switch, as seen in Figure 8, to connect multiple computers to one keyboard, monitor, and mouse.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Newer KVM switches have the capability to share USB devices and speakers with multiple computers. Typically, by pressing a button on the KVM switch, the user can change the control from one connected computer to another connected computer. Some models of the switch transfer control from one computer to another using a specific key sequence on a keyboard, such as <b>Ctrl > Ctrl > A > Enter</b> to control the first computer connected to the switch, and then <b>Ctrl > Ctrl > B > Enter</b> to transfer control to the next computer.</p>
