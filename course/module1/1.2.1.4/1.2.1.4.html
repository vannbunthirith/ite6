        <h1>Select the Power Supply</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Power supplies convert AC input to DC output voltages. Power supplies typically provide voltages of 3.3V, 5V, and 12V, and are measured in wattage. The power supply must provide enough power for the installed components and allow for other components that may be added at a later time. If you choose a power supply that powers only the current components, you might need to replace the power supply when other components are upgraded.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The table in the figure describes various factors to consider when selecting a power supply.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Be careful when connecting the power supply cables to other components. If you have a difficult time inserting a connector, try repositioning it, or check to make sure that no bent pins or foreign objects are in the way. If it is difficult to plug in a cable or other part, something is wrong. Cables, connectors, and components are designed to fit together snugly. Never force a connector or component. If a connector is plugged in incorrectly, it can damage the plug and the connector. Take your time and make sure that you are connecting the hardware correctly.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a table listing the following several factors and considerations affecting the choice of a power supply. Type of motherboard: The power supply must be compatible with the motherboard. Required wattage: Add the wattage for each component. If the wattage is not listed on a component, calculate it by multiplying its voltage and amperage. If the component requires different levels of wattage, use the higher requirement. Number of components: Make sure the power supply provides enough wattage to support the number and types of components plus another 25% at a minimum. Type of components: Make sure the power supply provides the right types of power connectors. Type of case: Make sure the power supply can be mounted in the desired case.</div>
