        <h1>Checking OS Compatibility</h1>
        <div>
          <p>An OS must be upgraded periodically to remain compatible with the latest hardware and software. It is also necessary to upgrade an OS when a manufacturer stops supporting it. Upgrading an OS can increase performance. New hardware products often require that the latest OS version be installed to operate correctly. While upgrading an OS may be expensive, you can gain enhanced functionality through new features and support for newer hardware.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: When newer versions of an OS are released, support for older versions is eventually withdrawn.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before upgrading the operating system, check the minimum hardware requirements of the new OS to ensure that it can be installed successfully on the computer.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Upgrade Assistant and Upgrade Advisor</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Microsoft provides free utilities called the Upgrade Assistant in Windows 8.1 and 8, and Upgrade Advisor in Windows 7 and Vista. Performing the same function, these utilities scan the system for hardware and software incompatibility issues in hardware before upgrading to newer editions of the Windows OS. Upgrade Assistant and Upgrade Advisor create a report of any problems and then guide you through the steps to resolve them. You can download the Upgrade Assistant and Upgrade Advisor from the Microsoft Windows website.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To use the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1</b>. Download and run the correct utility depending on the version of Windows that needs to be checked.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2</b>. Click <b>Start check</b>. The program scans your computer hardware, devices, and installed software. A compatibility report is presented.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3</b>. Click <b>Save Report</b> if you want to keep it or print it later.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4</b>. Examine the report. Record any recommended fixes for the issues found.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5</b>. Click <b>Close</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>After making the changes to hardware, devices, or software, Microsoft recommends running the utility again before installing the new OS.</p>
