            <b>System Restore</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This tool will restore the computer to an earlier restore point. Because System Restore can be accessed from within Windows or at boot time, this tool can help fixing a damaged system to boot up again. Figure 1 shows System Restore for Windows 8.x. Figure 2 shows System Restore for Windows 7 and Windows Vista.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Refresh your PC (Windows 8.x only)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 3, this tool will restore the computer's system software back to its factory state without deleting user files or removing modern apps. Computers tend to become slower as time passes. This is due normal usage of the file systems which can become full of fragmented files, orphan drivers and libraries. This tool will bring the system back to its factory state without much impact on user data. Refresh your computer will remove any installed Desktop apps.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Recovery Partition</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Some computers that have Windows installed contain a section of the disk that is inaccessible to the user. This partition, called a recovery partition, contains an image that can be used to restore the computer to its original configuration.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The recovery partition is often hidden to prevent from being used for anything other than restoration. To restore the computer using the recovery partition, you must use a special key or key combination when the computer is starting. Sometimes, the option to restore from the factory recovery partition is located in the BIOS. Contact the computer manufacturer to find out how to access the partition and restore the original configuration of the computer.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: If the operating system has been damaged because of a faulty hard drive, the recovery partition may also be corrupt and not able to recover the operating system.</p>
