        <h1>Storage Device Types</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As a technician, you might have to perform a clean installation of an OS. Perform a clean install in the following situations:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>When a computer is passed from one employee to another</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>When the OS is corrupt</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>When the primary hard drive is replaced in a computer</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The installation and initial booting of the OS is called the operating system setup. Although it is possible to install an OS over a network from a server or from a local hard drive, the most common installation method for a home or small business is through external media such as CDs, DVDs or USB drives. To install an OS from external media, configure the BIOS setup to boot the system from the media. Most modern BIOS should support booting from CD, DVD or USB.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: If the hardware is not supported by the OS, you may need to install third party drivers when performing a clean installation.</p>
          <p>Before the operating system can be installed, a storage media device must be chosen and prepared. Several types of storage devices are available and can be used to receive the new operating system. The two most common types of data storage devices used today are hard disk drives and flash memory-based drives.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Hard Disk Drives</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Although Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) are considered old technology, these drives are still common in modern computers and can be used for storing and retrieving data. HDDs contain a number of magnetic, spinning, rigid steel disks and magnetic heads mounted to a mobile arm. The magnetic head and is responsible for reading and writing data off the spinning disks.</p>

          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Flash Memory-Based Drives</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Flash memory is a type of non-volatile data storage medium that can be electrically erased and re-written. It became popular over the last decade as the flash technology evolved and became more reliable. Different types of flash memory are used in different applications:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>USB Flash Drives </b>- USB flash drives are a good solution for storing operating system installation images. They are fast, reliable, resilient and inexpensive. USB flash drives are comprised of flash memory and a small control board to govern data transfer. They are most commonly used to store operating system installation images, but they can also be used to store a full installation of an OS if space allows.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Solid State Drives (SSD)</b> - Another popular application for flash memory is the SSD. An alternative to hard disks, SSDs are disks that employ high performance flash memory technology to achieve fast data storage without the moving parts of HDDs. SSDs are faster and less prone to physical problems. Due the high performance type of flash memory used, SSDs tend to be more efficient than USB flash drives and are a great choice for OS hosting.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Solid State Hybrid Disks (SSHDs)</b> - A popular and less expensive option than SSDs, SSHD devices combine the speed of SSDs with the lower price of HDDs by packing both technologies in the same enclosure. In SSHDs, data is stored in an HDD, but a small flash memory is used to cache frequently used data. This allows for frequently used data to be accessed by the operating system at SSD speeds, while other data is transferred at HDD speeds. SSHDs are a good option for storing operating systems.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Embedded MultiMediaCard (eMMC)</b> - Although slower and less expensive than SSD, eMMC is very popular in cell phones, PDAs and digital cameras.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Regardless of the application, flash memory-based storage devices can be used to store entire installations of operating systems. With different levels of performance, flash-memory based drives allow for flexibility when designing modern computer hardware.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A few different standards govern the connection between computers. Hot swapping is a technique used in servers that allows devices such as hard drives to be connected or disconnected without powering down the computer. While the entire computer hardware and OS must be designed to support this feature, it is very useful in servers as it allows for part replacement without interrupting service.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When the storage device type has been chosen, it must be prepared to receive the new operating system. Modern operating systems ship with an <i>installer </i>program. Installers usually prepare the disk to receive the operating system, but it is crucial for a technician to understand the terms and methods involved in this preparation.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is an interactive graphic that explains the following components of a hard drive. Hard Drive Component: Actuator Shaft, Description: The actuator shaft holds the actuator arm and acts as a rotation point. Hard Drive Component: Actuator Arm, Description: The actuator arm holds the read/write head and moves it between tracks on the platter. Hard Drive Component: Spindle, Description: The spindle holds the platters and spins them. Hard Drive Component: Platters/Disks, Description: Platters are disks coated with magnetic media.Figure 2 on this page is an interactive graphic that explains the following structure of a hard drive platter. Platter Section: Track, Description: A track is one complete circle on one side of platter where data is written and read. A track is broken into multiple sectors. Platter Section: Cluster, Description: A cluster is a group of sectors allocated for data storage. The file system allocates clusters for storage because most files are larger than one sector. Platter Section: Sector, Description: A sector is a portion of a track that contains synchronization information, data, and error correcting code (ECC). Platter Section: Cylinder, Description: A cylinder is where tracks are in alignment above and below each other on many platters. Platter Section: Intersector Gap, Description: This is the gap which defines the boundaries between sectors. Platter Section: Intertrack Gap, Description: This is the gap which defines the boundaries between tracks. Platter Section: Synchronisation Information, Description: This is the header information and data used by the drive and the controller to help with data storage. The synchronisation information and data form the first two parts of the intertrack gap. Platter Section: Error Correcting Code (ECC), Description: This code helps to verify that the data in the sector was written correctly. The ECC forms the third part (trailer) of the intertrack gap.</div>
