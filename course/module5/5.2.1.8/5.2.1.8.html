        <h1>Account Creation</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When users attempt to log in to a device or to access system resources, Windows uses the process of authentication to verify the identity of the users. Authentication occurs when users enter a username and password to access a user account. Windows OSs use Single-Sign On (SSO) authentication, which allows users to log in once to access all system features versus requiring them to log in each time they need to access an individual resource.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>User accounts allow multiple users to share a single computer using their own files and settings. Windows 8.1, Windows 7 and Windows Vista have three types of user accounts: Administrator, Standard, and Guest. Each account type provides a user with a different level of control over system resources.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Windows 8.1, the account created during the installation process has administrator privileges. A user with administrator privileges can make changes that impact all users of the computer, such as altering security settings or installing software for all users. Accounts with administrator privileges should be used only to manage a computer and not for regular use, because drastic changes that affect everyone can be made when using the administrator account. Attackers also seek out an administrator account because it is so powerful. For this reason, it is recommended that a standard user account is created for regular use.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Standard user accounts can be created at any time by the Administrator. A standard user account can use most of the capability of a computer; however, the user cannot make changes that affect other users or the security of the computer. For example, a standard user cannot install a printer.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Individuals without a user account on the computer can use a guest account. A guest account has limited permissions and must be turned on by an administrator. The Manage Accounts control panel app is used to manage user accounts. The Control Panel is a Windows location that contains many tools for manipulating windows configurations and settings. There are many ways to access the Control Panel in each version of Windows.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To access the Control Panel in Windows 7 and Vista, click the <b>Start</b> button located on the left side of the task bar on the bottom of the desktop. This will display the Start menu. Click <b>Control Panel</b> in the Start menu. You can also click the <b>Start</b> button and type <b>control</b> in the <b>Search programs and files</b> box and press <b>Enter</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Windows 8 interface is very different from Windows 7 and Vista. To access the Control Panel from the desktop in Windows 8, place the cursor in the upper-right corner of the desktop and wait for the Charms to appear. Click the <b>Search</b> charm and type control in the Search box and press <b>Enter</b>. On a touch screen, you can also swipe your finger in from the right side of the screen to display the charms.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Windows 8 does not come with a Start menu by default. Windows 8 uses a Start screen instead. To access the Start screen, first access the Charms and click the <b>Start</b> icon. To access the Control Panel from the Start screen, type <b>control</b> and press <b>Enter</b>. You can also access the Start screen in Windows 8.1 by clicking the <b>Start</b> button located on the left side of the task bar on the bottom of the desktop.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Control Panel can be viewed in different ways, depending on the version of Windows you are using. Throughout this course, paths to the Control Panel tools will assume that the view is set to large or small icons. This can be set by choosing <b>Large icons</b> or <b>Small icons</b> in the <b>View by:</b> drop-down menu in the Control Panel. In Windows Vista, icons can be viewed by clicking <b>Classic View</b> in the Control Panel.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Throughout this course, paths to Control Panel tools begin with <b>Control Panel</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To manage a user account in Windows 8.1 and Windows 8, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Control Panel > User Accounts > Manage Accounts</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To create or remove a user account in Windows 7 and Windows Vista, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Start > Control Panel > User Accounts > Add or remove user accounts</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
