        <h1>Bluetooth Pairing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Bluetooth pairing is when two Bluetooth devices establish a connection to share resources. In order for the devices to pair, the Bluetooth radios must be turned on, and one device begins searching for other devices. Other devices must be set to discoverable mode, also called visible, so that they can be detected. When a Bluetooth device is in discoverable mode, it transmits the following information when another Bluetooth device requests it:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Name</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bluetooth class</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Services that the device can use</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Technical information, such as the features or the Bluetooth specification that it supports</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>During the pairing process, a PIN may be requested to authenticate the pairing process, as shown in Figure 1. The PIN is often a number, but can also be a numeric code or passkey. The PIN is stored using pairing services, so it does not have to be entered the next time the device tries to connect. This is convenient when using a headset with a smartphone, because they are paired automatically when the headset is turned on and within range.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To pair a Bluetooth device with an Android device, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1</b>. Follow the instructions for your device to place it in discoverable mode.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2</b>. Check the instructions for your device to find the connection PIN.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3</b>. Select <b>Settings > Bluetooth</b> (under Wireless & Networks section)</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4</b>. Touch the <b>Bluetooth</b> toggle to turn it on.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5</b>. Wait until Android scans and locates the Bluetooth device previously placed in discoverable mode.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 6</b>. Touch the discovered device to select it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 7</b>. Enter the PIN.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To pair a Bluetooth device with an iOS device, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> Follow the instructions for your device to place it in discoverable mode.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> Check the instructions for your device to find the connection PIN.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> Select <b>Settings > Bluetooth</b>.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4.</b> Touch <b>Bluetooth</b> to turn it on, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5.</b> Touch the discovered device to select it.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 6.</b> Type the PIN.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For some devices, this process may vary slightly. Figures 1 and Figure 3 show a Microsoft Bluetooth Keyboard being paired with Android and iOS, respectively. Notice how the keyboard provides a PIN to be typed on the keyboard before the pairing process can be completed.</p>
