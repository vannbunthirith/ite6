        <h1>Convenience Features</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Modern mobile devices are essentially small computers. As a result, a number of convenience features are being developed for modern smartphones. Below are a few of these features:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Wi-Fi Calling</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Instead of using the cellular carrier's network, modern smartphones can use the Internet to transport voice calls by taking advantage of a local Wi-Fi hotspot. This is called Wi-Fi calling. Locations, such as coffee shops, work places, libraries, or homes, usually have Wi-Fi networks connected to the Internet. The phone can transport voice calls through the local Wi-Fi hotspot. If there is no Wi-Fi hotspot within reach, the phone will use the cellular carrier's network to transport voice calls.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Wi-Fi calling is very useful in areas with poor cellular coverage because it uses a local Wi-Fi hotspot to fill the gaps. The Wi-Fi hotspot must be able to guarantee a throughput of at least 1Mbps to the Internet for a good quality call. When Wi-Fi calling is enabled and in use during a voice call, the phone will display "Wi-Fi" next to the carrier name.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To enable Wi-Fi calling on Android, as shown in Figure 1, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > More </b>(under Wireless & networks section) <b>> Wi-Fi Calling ></b> Tap on the toggle to turn it on</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To enable Wi-Fi calling on iOS, as shown in Figure 2, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > Phone</b> and turn on Wi-Fi Calling</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Not all cellular carriers allow Wi-Fi calling. If you cannot enable it on your phone, your carrier or mobile device probably does not support it. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Mobile Payments</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Mobile payments refer to any payments made through a mobile phone, as shown in Figure 3. A few mobile payment methods include:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Premium SMS based transactional payments - </b>consumers send a SMS message to a carrier's special phone number containing a payment request. The seller is informed the payment has been received and is cleared to release the goods. The charge is then added to the customer's phone bill. Slow speed, poor reliability, and poor security are a few shortcomings of this method.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Direct Mobile Billing - </b>Using a mobile billing option during check-out, a user identifies him or herself (usually through a two-factor authentication) and allows the charge to be added to the mobile service bill. This is very popular in Asia and has the following benefits: security, convenience, and no need for bank cards or credit cards.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Mobile Web Payments - </b>The consumer uses the web or dedicated apps to complete the transaction. This method relies on the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and usually requires the use of credit cards or a pre-registered online payment solution, such as PayPal.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Contactless NFC (Near Field Communication) – </b>This method is used mostly in physical store transactions. A consumer pays for good or services by waving the phone near the payment system. Based on an unique ID, the payment is charged directly against a pre-paid account or bank account. NFC is also used in mass-transportation services, the public parking sector, and many more consumer areas.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Virtual Private Network </b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a private network that uses a public network (usually the Internet) to connect remote sites or users together. Instead of using a dedicated leased line, a VPN uses "virtual" connections routed through the Internet from the company's private network to the remote site or employee.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many companies create their own Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to accommodate the needs of remote employees and distant offices. With the proliferation of mobile devices, it was a natural move to add VPN clients to smartphones and tablets.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When a VPN is established from a client to a server, the client accesses the network behind the server as if it was connected directly to that network. Because VPN protocols also allow for data encryption, the communication between client and server is secure and attractive to businesses.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To create a new VPN connection on Android, as shown in Figure 4, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > More</b> (under Wireless & networks section) <b>> VPN ></b> Tap on the + sign to add a VPN connection</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To create a new VPN connection on iOS, as shown in Figure 5, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > General > VPN ></b> Add VPN Configuration...</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When the VPN information has been added to the device, that device must be started before traffic can be sent and received through it.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To start a VPN on Android, as shown in Figure 6, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > General > VPN ></b> Select the desired VPN connection <b>></b> enter username and password <b>></b> tap <b>CONNECT</b></p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To start a VPN on iOS, as shown in Figure 7, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings ></b> Toggle VPN to on</p>
