        <h1>Internet Email</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Unlike local email where the server is controlled by an in-house administrator, Internet email refers to an email service that is hosted somewhere on the Internet and controlled by a third party team of administrators.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As more people began to use email, there became a need for an email service for people with little to no technical knowledge. Companies deploy, host and manage the service, leaving the users the task of managing their personal messages. Internet Email services usually provide a web-based interface to allow users to access their mailboxes through any web browser. In addition to the web interface, companies often also provide an email client app that can be downloaded and installed on mobile devices. Email client apps provide a better user experience when compared to the web interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Mobile device manufacturers typically add email apps to their operating systems. These apps often allow for a number of different Internet email services to be configured and used without the need for specific mobile email client apps. These are some common options for accessing an Internet Email account:</p>
