            <b>Virtual assistants</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A digital assistant, sometimes called a virtual assistant, is a program that can understand natural conversational language and perform tasks for the end user. Modern mobile devices are powerful computers, making them the perfect platform for digital assistants. Popular digital assistants currently include Google Now for Android, Siri for iOS, and Cortana for Windows Phone 8.1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These digital assistants rely on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and voice recognition technology to understand conversational-style voice commands. As the end user interacts with these digital assistants, sophisticated algorithms predict the user's needs and fulfill requests. By pairing simple voice requests with other inputs, such as GPS location, these assistants can perform several tasks, including playing a specific song, performing a web search, taking a note, or sending an email.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Google Now</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To access Google Now on an Android device, as shown in Figure 1, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Simply say "Okay google". Google Now will activate and start listening to requests, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Siri</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To access Siri on an iOS device, as shown in Figure 3, press and hold the Home button. Siri will activate and start listening to requests.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Alternatively, Siri can be configured to start listening to commands when it hears "Hey Siri", as shown in Figure 4. To enable "Hey Siri", use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > General > Siri ></b> Toggle Allow "Hey Siri" to on.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Cortana</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To access Cortana on a Windows device, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Press and hold the Search button. Cortana will activate and start listening to requests.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Emergency Notification</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) are emergency messages sent by authorities through mobile carriers. In the U.S.A., government partners include: local and state public safety agencies, FEMA, the FCC, the Department of Homeland Security, and the National Weather Service. Mobile carriers do not charge for WEA messages.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Timely alerts can help to save lives during an emergency. With WEA, alerts can be sent to mobile devices without the user having to download an app or subscribe to a service.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>WEAs look like a regular text message and contain the type and time of the alert, any recommended action and the agency issuing the alert. WEAs are relatively short, having no more than 90 characters. To differentiate from a regular message, WEA messages will be followed by a distinct pattern vibration and audio tone.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are three different kinds of alerts:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Presidential Alerts –</b> Alerts issued by the President or a designee.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Imminent Threat Alerts –</b> Alerts include severe man-made or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes, where an imminent threat to life or property exists.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>AMBER Alerts –</b> Alerts meet the U.S. Department of Justice's criteria to help law enforcement to search for and locate an abducted child.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You may need to register a device with a carrier, or provide some kind of unique identifier. Every mobile device has an unique 15-digit number called an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). This number identifies the device to a carrier’s network. The numbers come from a family of devices called the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). The number can often be found in the configuration settings of the device, or in a battery compartment, if the battery is removable.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The user of the device is also identified using an unique number called the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). The IMSI is often programmed on the subscriber identity module (SIM) card, or can be programmed on the phone itself, depending on the network type.</p>
