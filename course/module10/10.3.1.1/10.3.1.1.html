        <h1>Wireless Data Network</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Mobile devices give people the freedom to work, learn, play, and communicate wherever they want. People using mobile devices do not need to be tied to a physical location to send and receive voice, video, and data communications. College campuses use wireless networks to allow students to sign up for classes, watch lectures, and submit assignments in areas where physical connections to the network are unavailable. With mobile devices becoming more powerful, many tasks that needed to be performed on large computers connected to physical networks can now be completed using mobile devices on wireless networks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A connection to the Internet through a cellular company is expensive and relies on cellular towers and satellites to create a mesh of global coverage. Typically, cellular companies charge their customers based on the amount of data they transport through the cellular network. A cellular connection can become expensive.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Coffee shops, libraries, work places or homes typically use a different type of connection to Internet. These connections are usually based on established cable TV or telephone lines to connect the building to the service provider. Companies providing this type of connection to the Internet usually charge a flat fee for a specific speed, regardless of the amount of data transported. The relatively low cost of this type connection makes it possible for businesses to provide a free Internet connection to their customers. The customers connect to the Internet through the local wireless network of that business.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Almost all mobile devices are capable of connecting to Wi-Fi networks. It is advisable to connect to Wi-Fi networks when possible because data used over Wi-Fi does not count against the cellular data plan. Also, because Wi-Fi radios use less power than cellular radios, connecting to Wi-Fi networks conserves battery power. Like other Wi-Fi-enabled devices, it is important to use security when connecting to Wi-Fi networks. These precautions should be taken to protect Wi-Fi communications on mobile devices: </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use the highest Wi-Fi security framework possible. Currently WPA2 security is the most secure.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Enable security on home networks. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Never send login or password information using clear, unencrypted text. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use a VPN connection when possible. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>To turn Wi-Fi on or off, use the following path for Android, shown in Figure 1, and iOS, shown in Figure 2:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > Wi-Fi ></b> turn Wi-Fi on or off</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To connect an Android device when it is within the range of a Wi-Fi network, turn on Wi-Fi, and the device then searches for all available Wi-Fi networks, and displays them in a list. Touch a Wi-Fi network in the list to connect. Enter a password if needed. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When a mobile device roams out of the range of the Wi-Fi network, it attempts to connect to another Wi-Fi network in range. If no Wi-Fi networks are in range, the mobile device connects to the cellular data network. When Wi-Fi is on, it automatically connects to any Wi-Fi network that it has connected to previously. If the network is new, the mobile device either displays a list of available networks that can be used or asks if it should connect to it.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If a mobile device does not prompt to connect to a Wi-Fi network, the network SSID broadcast may be turned off, or the device may not be set to connect automatically. Manually configure the Wi-Fi settings on the mobile device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To connect to a Wi-Fi network manually on an Android device, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> Select <b>Settings > Add network</b>.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> Enter the network SSID.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> Touch <b>Security</b> and select a security type.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4.</b> Touch <b>Password</b> and enter the password.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5.</b> Touch <b>Save</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To connect to a Wi-Fi network manually on an iOS device, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> Select <b>Settings > Wi-Fi > Other</b>.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> Enter the network SSID.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> Touch <b>Security</b> and select a security type.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4.</b> Touch <b>Other Network</b>.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5.</b> Touch <b>Password</b> and enter the password.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 6.</b> Touch <b>Join</b>.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Tethering</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If a user wants to synchronize data, share files or an Internet connection, a connection can be made between two devices using a cable, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. This connection is called tethering. For example, a user may need to connect a computer to the Internet but no Wi-Fi or wired connection is available. A cell phone can be used as a bridge to the Internet, through the cellular carrier’s network.</p>
