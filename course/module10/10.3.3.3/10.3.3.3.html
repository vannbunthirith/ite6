        <h1>Android Email Configuration</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Android devices are capable of using advanced communication applications and data services. Many of these applications and features require the use of web services provided by Google. When you configure an Android mobile device for the first time, you are prompted to sign in to your Google account with your Gmail email address and password.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>By signing in to your Gmail account, the Google Play store, data and settings backup, and other Google services become accessible. The device synchronizes contacts, email messages, apps, downloaded content, and other information from Google services. If you do not have a Gmail account, you can use the Google account sign-in page to create one.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: If you want to restore Android settings to a tablet that you have previously backed up, you must sign in to the account when setting up the tablet for the first time. You cannot restore your Android settings if you sign in after the initial setup.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>After initial setup, access your mailbox by touching the Gmail app icon. Android devices also have an email app for connecting to other email accounts, but it simply redirects the user to the Gmail app in later versions of Android, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To add an email account, perform the following steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1</b>. Touch the <b>Email</b> or the <b>Gmail</b> app icon.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2</b>. Choose the type of account, as shown in Figure 2, and tap <b>NEXT</b>.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3</b>. Enter the device's passcode if needed.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4</b>. Enter the email address you want to use and password.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5</b>. Tap <b>Create New Account</b>.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 6</b>. Enter your first name, last name, email address and password.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 7</b>. Provide a phone number for account recovery purposes (optional).</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 8</b>. Review the account information and tap Next.</p>
