        <h1>Introduction to Linux and OS X Operating Systems</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Unix is a non-proprietary operating system based on the C programming language and user command interface. Some popular desktop operating systems are based on UNIX, such as Linux, OS X, Android and iOS.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Linux</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Linux operating systems are used in practically every platform, including embedded-systems, wearable devices, smartwatches, cellphones, netbooks, PCs, servers and super computers. Although Linux is getting a larger user base, Android, a modified version of Linux, may be responsible for the operating system's spread throughout the consumer market.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows the desktop of Ubuntu Linux.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>OS X (Formerly known as Mac OS X)</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The operating system for Macintosh computers is OS X. It is formerly known as Mac OS X. OS X is streamlined for Macintosh computer hardware, and it can work seamlessly with other Apple devices, such as iPhones.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows the desktop of OS X 10.10 Yosemite</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note: </b>This chapter focuses on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) and Apple OS X 10.10 (Yosemite).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A special tool built in to OS X allows some unique installation configurations. The tool is called Netboot and it can boot multiple OS X machines remotely. After the machines are rebooted, any content from the session is gone. This can be used in a setting such as a classroom to reset the computers at the end of a class or day. The tool can also place an OS installation or a program on multiple computers at the same time. This would be useful in a corporate enterprise to image or upgrade all computers.</p>
