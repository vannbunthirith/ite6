        <h1>Restrictions on Failed Login Attempts</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To unlock a mobile device when a passcode has been properly implemented requires entering the correct PIN, password, pattern, or other passcode type. In theory, a passcode, such as a PIN, could be guessed given enough time and perseverance. To prevent someone from trying to guess a passcode, mobile devices can be set to perform defined actions after a certain number of incorrect attempts have been made.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For Android devices, the number of failed attempts before lockout depends on the device and version of Android OS. It is common that an Android device will lock when a passcode has failed from 4 to 12 times. After a device is locked, you can unlock it by entering the Gmail account information used to set up the device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For iOS devices, the device is disabled after five failed attempts, as shown in Figure 1. On the sixth failed attempt, the device remains disabled for 1 minute. Each failed attempt after six results in additional waiting time. The chart in Figure 2 shows the results of failing to enter the correct passcode.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The incorrect passwords must be different from each other to trigger the waiting time.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Turn on the Erase data option, shown in Figure 3. If the passcode fails 10 times, the screen goes black, and all data on the device is deleted. To restore the iOS device and data, you must connect it to the computer to which it was last synchronized and use the Restore option in iTunes.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On iOS, to increase security, the passcode is used as part of the encryption key for the entire system. Because the passcode is not stored anywhere, no one can gain access to the user data on iOS devices, including Apple. The system depends on the user to provide the passcode before the system can be unlocked and decrypted for use. A forgotten passcode will render user data unreachable, forcing the user to perform a full restore through iTunes on the computer, where the device was last synchronized.</p>

The screen shows the message, “iPhone is disabled, try again in 1 minute.” Figure 2 on this page is a table that lists the following results of failing to enter the correct passcode on an iPhone. Failed attempts: 1 to 5, Additional time device is disabled: 0, total time device is disabled: 0. Failed attempts: 6, Additional time device is disabled: 1 minute, total time device is disabled: 1 minute. Failed attempts: 7, Additional time device is disabled: 5 minutes, total time device is disabled: 6 minutes. Failed attempts: 8, Additional time device is disabled: 15 minutes, total time device is disabled: 21 minutes. Failed attempts: 9, Additional time device is disabled: 60 minutes, total time device is disabled: 81 minutes.
