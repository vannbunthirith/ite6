        <h1>Home Screen Items</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Much like a desktop or laptop computer, mobile devices organize icons and widgets on multiple screens for easy access. One screen is designated as the home screen, as shown in Figure 1. Additional screens are accessed by sliding the home screen to the left or right. Each screen contains navigation icons, the main area where icons and widgets are accessed, and notification and system icons. The screen indicator displays which screen is currently displaying.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Navigation Icons</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Android OS uses the system bar to navigate apps and screens. The system bar is always displayed at the bottom of every screen.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The system bar contains the following buttons, as shown in Figure 2:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Back</b> - Returns to the previous screen. If the on-screen keyboard is displayed, this button closes it. Continuing to press the Back button navigates to through each previous screen until the home screen is displayed.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Home</b> - Returns to the home screen. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Recent Apps</b> - Opens thumbnail images of recently used apps. To open an app, touch its thumbnail. Swipe a thumbnail to remove it from the list.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Menu</b> – If available, Menu shows additional options for the current screen.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Google search</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Android devices often come with a default Google search app preinstalled. Touch and then type text into the box to search the device and the Internet for anything. Touch the microphone icon to enter the pattern to be searched using speech.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Special Enhancements</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As a result of Android’s open source code, some manufacturers add functionality to the Android OS before deploying it in their devices. For example, some Samsung Android tablets have a feature called the Mini App Tray, which contains shortcuts to apps that can be used at any time. Many manufacturers have followed that trend resulting in apps or GUI elements that are only present in devices built by that specific manufacturer. This chapter focuses on an unmodified version of Android.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Notification and System Icons</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Each Android device has an area that contains system icons, such as the clock, battery status, and radio signal status for Wi-Fi and provider networks. Apps such as email, text messaging, and Facebook often display status icons to indicate communication activity. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To open the notification area on Android devices, swipe down from the top of the screen, as shown in Figure 3. You can do the following when notifications are open:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Respond to a notification by touching it.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dismiss a notification by swiping it off the screen to either side.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dismiss all notifications with the icon.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Toggle often-used settings.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Adjust the brightness of the screen.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Open the Settings menu with the quick settings icon.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Another element of the Android UI is the launcher. The launcher defines the format of the home screens, the look and feel of its icons, buttons, color scheme and animations. Although Android includes a stock launcher, there are also other launchers available in the Google Play store:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Nova Launcher</b> – This launcher, shown in Figure 4, offers many animation options, folder views and desktop screen behavior. While the free version should suit most users, the paid version allows for gesture customization. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Google Now Launcher</b> - Created by Google, this launcher comes installed by default in Nexus devices. It turns the left most screen into Google Now, allowing quick access to Google Now cards, searches and various voice commands.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Action Launcher</b> – This launcher introduces a slide-in side bar to house the apps to allow quicker app access.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
