        <h1>Remote Lock and Remote Wipe</h1>
        <div>
          <p>If attempts to locate a mobile device have failed, there are other security features that can prevent data on the device from being compromised. Usually the same apps that perform remote location have security features. Two of the most common remote security features are:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Remote Lock</b> – The remote lock feature for iOS devices is called lost mode, and is shown in Figure 1. The Android Device Manager calls this feature Lock. It allows you to lock the device with a passcode so others cannot gain access to the data in the device. For example, the user can display custom messages, or keep the phone from ringing due to incoming calls or text messages. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Remote Wipe</b> - The remote wipe feature for iOS devices is called erase phone, and is shown in Figure 2. The Android Device Manager calls this feature Erase. It deletes all data from the device and returns it to a factory state. To restore data to the device, Android users must set up the device using a Gmail account, and iOS users must synchronize their device to iTunes.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: For these remote security measures to function, the device must be powered on and connected to a cellular or Wi-Fi network.</p>
