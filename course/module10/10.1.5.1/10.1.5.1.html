        <h1>Screen Orientation and Calibration</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            <b>Screen Orientation</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Most mobile device screens are rectangular in shape. This shape allows content to be viewed in two different ways: portrait and landscape. Some content fits better in a specific view. For example, video fills the screen in landscape mode, but may not fill half the screen in portrait mode. An e-book viewed in portrait mode seems very natural because it is similar in shape to an actual book. Typically, users can choose the viewing mode that is the most comfortable for them for each type of content.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many mobile devices contain sensors, such as an accelerometer, that can determine how they are being held. Content is automatically rotated to the position of the device. This feature is useful, for example, when taking a photograph. When the device is turned to landscape mode, the camera app also turns to landscape mode. Also, when a user is creating a text, turning the device to landscape mode automatically turns the app to landscape mode, making the keyboard larger and wider.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When using an Android device, to enable automatic rotation, as shown in Figure 1, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > Display > check Auto-rotate screen</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When using an iOS device, to enable automatic rotation, as shown in Figure 2, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Swipe up from the very bottom of the screen > tap the lock icon on the right</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Screen Calibration</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When using a mobile device, you may need to adjust the brightness of the screen. Increase the screen brightness level when using a mobile device outdoors because bright sunlight makes the screen very difficult to read. In contrast, a very low brightness is helpful when reading a book on a mobile device at night. Some mobile devices can be configured to auto-adjust the brightness depending on the amount of surrounding light. The device must have a light sensor to use auto-brightness. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The LCD screen for most mobile devices uses the most battery power. Lowering the brightness or using auto-brightness helps conserve battery power. Set the brightness to the lowest setting to get the most battery life from the device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When using an Android device, to configure screen brightness, as shown in Figure 3, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > Display > Brightness > slide the brightness to the desired level </b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Alternatively, tap the <b>Adaptive Brightness </b>toggle to allow the device to decide the optimal screen brightness based on the amount of light availed.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When using an iOS device, to configure screen brightness, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Swipe up from the very bottom of the screen > tap the lock icon on the right</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Alternatively, to configure brightness in the Settings menu, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > Display & Brightness ></b> slide the brightness to the desired level or tap the <b>Auto-Brightness</b> toggle.</p>
          <p></p>
