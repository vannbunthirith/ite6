        <h1>Patching and Updating Operating Systems</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Like the OS on a desktop or laptop, you can update or patch the OS on mobile devices. Updates add functionality or increase performance. Patches can fix security problems or issues with hardware and software.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Because there are so many different Android mobile devices, updates and patches are not released as one package for all devices. Sometimes a new version of Android cannot install on older devices where the hardware does not meet the minimum specifications. These devices might receive patches to fix known issues, but not receive OS upgrades.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Android updates and patches use an automated process for delivery. When a carrier or manufacturer has an update for a device, a notification on the device indicates that an update is ready, as shown in the figure. Touch the update to begin the download and installation process.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>iOS updates also use an automated process for delivery, and devices that do not meet the hardware requirements are also excluded. To check for updates to iOS, connect the device to iTunes. A notice to download opens if updates are available. To manually check for updates, click the <b>Check for Update </b>button in the iTunes Summary pane.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are two other types of updates for mobile device radio firmware that are important. These are called baseband updates and consist of the Preferred Roaming List (PRL) and the Primary Rate ISDN (PRI). The PRL is configuration information that a cellular phone needs to communicate on networks other than its own, so that a call can be made outside of the carrier’s network. The PRI configure the data rates between the device and the cell tower. This ensures that the device is able to communicate with the tower at the correct rate.</p>
