        <h1>Identify Common Problems and Solutions</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Computer problems can be attributed to hardware, software, networks, or some combination of the three. You will resolve some types of computer problems more often than others. Figure 1 is a chart of common mobile device problems and solutions. Figure 2 is a chart of common mobile device OS security problems. Figure 3 is chart of common Linux and OS X problems and solutions.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many computer problems can be solved by simply turning off the device and turning it back on. When a mobile device does not respond to a reboot, a reset may need to be performed. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These are some of the ways that Android devices can be reset, check the documentation for your mobile device to determine how to reset your device:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hold down the power button until the mobile device turns off. Turn the device on again.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hold down the power button and the volume down button until the mobile device turns off. Turn the device on again.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>This is how iOS devices can be reset:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Press and hold both the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button for 10 seconds, until the Apple logo appears.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>In some cases, when a standard reset does not correct the problem, a factory reset may need to be performed. To perform a factory reset on an Android device, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > Backup and reset > Factory data reset > Reset device</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To perform a factory reset on an iOS device, use the following path:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION</b>: A factory reset restores the device to the state when it left the factory. All settings and user data is deleted from the device when a factory reset is performed. Be sure to back up any data and record any settings before performing a factory reset because all data and settings will be lost after performing a factory reset.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When a reboot does not fix a PC, more investigation should be done. You may find that some configuration should be changed, software updates are required or a misbehaving program is the culprit and must be reinstalled.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is a table that lists the following common problems and solutions for mobile device operating systems. Identify the problem: The mobile device will not connect to the Internet, probable causes: Wi-Fi is turned off, Wi-Fi settings are incorrect, Airplane mode is turned on, possible solutions: Turn on Wi-Fi, reconfigure the Wi-Fi settings, turn off Airplane mode. Identify the problem: An app fails to respond, probable causes: The app does not work correctly, the app failed to close, possible solutions: Force the app to close, restart the mobile device, reinstall the app, remove and reinsert the battery, if possible, reset the mobile device. Identify the problem: The mobile device fails to respond, probable causes: The operating system has encountered an error, an app has caused the operating system to become unresponsive, possible solutions: Restart the mobile device, remove and reinsert the battery, if possible, reset the mobile device. Identify the problem: The mobile device cannot send or receive email, probable causes: The mobile device is not connected to the Internet, the email account settings are incorrect, possible solutions: Connect the device to a Wi-Fi or cellular data network, reconfigure the email account settings. Identify the problem: The mobile device cannot install additional apps or save photos, probable causes: The mobile device is out of storage space, possible solutions: Insert a memory card or replace the memory card with a larger one, if possible, remove unnecessary files, uninstall unnecessary apps. Identify the problem: A mobile device cannot connect with a Bluetooth device, Probable causes: Bluetooth is not enabled on the mobile device, the Bluetooth device is out of range of the mobile device, the Bluetooth device is not turned on, possible solutions: Enable Bluetooth on the mobile device, move the Bluetooth device to within range of the mobile device, turn on the Bluetooth device. Identify the problem: A mobile device cannot pair with a Bluetooth device, probable causes: Bluetooth is not enabled on the mobile device, the Bluetooth device is not turned on, the pin code is incorrect, possible solutions: Enable Bluetooth on the mobile device, turn on the Bluetooth device, enter the correct pin code. Figure 2 on this page is a table that lists the following common problems and solutions for Linux and OS X operating systems. Identify the problem: The automatic backup operation does not start, probable causes: Time Machine is turned off in OS X, Deja Dup is turned off in Linux, possible solutions: Turn on Time Machine in OS X, turn on Deja Dup in Linux. Identify the problem: The directory appears empty, probable causes: The directory is the mount point for another disk or partition, the files were accidentally deleted, possible solutions: Remount the disk using the correct directory with Disk Utility for OS X, remount the disk using the correct directory with Disks for Linux, restore the deleted files from backup using Time machine or Deja Dup. Identify the problem: An application stops responding in OS X, probable causes: The application has stopped working, the application was using a resource that became unavailable, possible solutions: Force Quit the application. Identify the problem: Wi-Fi is not accessible using Ubuntu, probable causes: The wireless NIC driver did not install correctly, possible solutions: Install the Linux driver from the manufacturer’s website, if available, install the Linux driver from the Ubuntu repositories, if available. Identify the problem: OS X cannot read the remote optical disc using Remote Disc., probable causes: The Mac already has an optical drive installed, the option to request permission to use the optical drive has been enabled, possible solutions: Place the media in the local optical drive, accept the request for permission to use the drive.</div>
