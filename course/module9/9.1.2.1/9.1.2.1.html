        <h1>LCD, LED, and OLED Displays</h1>
        <div>
          <p>There are three types of laptop displays:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Liquid-crystal display (LCD)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Light-emitting diode (LED)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Organic light-emitting diode (OLED)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The two most common technologies used in the manufacturing of LCD displays are Twisted Nematic (TN) and In-Plane switching (IPS). TN is the most common and the oldest. TN displays offer high brightness, uses less power than IPS, and are inexpensive to manufacture. IPS displays offer better color reproduction and better viewing angles, but have low contrast and slow response time. Manufactures are now producing Super-IPS (S-IPS) panels, at reasonable prices, that have improved response times and contrast.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>LED displays use less power and have a longer lifespan than LCD displays, making them the display choice for many laptop manufactures. </p>
          <p>Organic LED (OLED) technology is commonly used for mobile devices and digital cameras, but can also be found in some laptops. With OLED displays, every pixel is individually lit. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Some laptops now come with detachable touch screens that can be used like a tablet when the display is detached. Other laptops permit the keyboard to fold back behind the display to allow the laptop to function like a tablet. To accommodate these types of laptops, Windows will rotate the display 90, 180, or 270 degrees automatically or by pressing the Control + Alt keys simultaneously with the arrow key for which way you want the laptop to face. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Laptops with touchscreens have a special glass piece attached to the front of the screen, known as a digitizer. The digitizer converts the touch actions (press, swipe, etc.) into a digital signal that is processed by the laptop.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On many laptops, a small pin on the laptop cover contacts a switch when the case is closed, called a cutoff switch. The cutoff switch helps conserve power by turning off the display. If this switch breaks or is dirty, the display remains dark while the laptop is open. Carefully clean this switch to restore normal operation.</p>
