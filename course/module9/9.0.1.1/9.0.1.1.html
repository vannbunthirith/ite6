        <div>
          <p>The first laptops were used primarily by business people who needed to access and enter data when they were away from the office. The use of laptops was limited due to expense, weight, and limited capabilities compared to less expensive desktops. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Improvements in technology have allowed the laptop to become lightweight, powerful, and much more affordable. Because of this, laptops are found in just about every setting today. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Laptops run the same operating systems as desktop computers and most come with built in Wi-Fi, webcam, microphone, speakers, and ports to attach external components.</p>
          <p></p>
