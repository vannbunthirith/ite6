        <h1>Power Management</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Advances in power management and battery technology are increasing the amount of time that a laptop can be powered from a battery. Many batteries can power a laptop for 10 hours or more. Configuring laptop power settings to better manage power usage is important to ensure that the battery is used efficiently. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Power management controls the flow of electricity to the components of a computer. The Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) creates a bridge between the hardware and the operating system and allows technicians to create power management schemes to get the best performance from a laptop. The ACPI states shown in the figure are applicable to most computers, but they are particularly important when managing power in laptops. </p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a table that lists the following ACPI states. State: S0, description: The computer is on and the CPU is running. State: S1, description: The CPU and RAM are still receiving power, but unused devices are powered down. State: S2, description: The CPU is off, but the RAM is refreshed. The system is in a lower mode than S1. State: S3, description: The CPU is off, and the RAM is set to a slow refresh rate. This mode is often called "Save to RAM". This state is known as the suspend mode. State: S4, description: The CPU and RAM are off. The contents of RAM have been saved to a temporary file on the hard disk. This mode is also called "saved to disk". This state is known as hibernation mode. State: S5, description: The computer is off.</div>
