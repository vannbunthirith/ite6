        <h1>Internal Storage Drive and Optical Drive</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The form factor of an internal storage device is smaller for a laptop than for a desktop computer. Laptop drives are 1.8 in. (4.57 cm.) or 2.5 in. (6.35 cm.) in width.  Most storage devices are CRUs, unless a warranty requires technical assistance.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before purchasing a new internal or external storage device, check the laptop documentation or the website of the manufacturer for compatibility requirements. Documentation often contains FAQs that may be helpful. It is also important to research known laptop component issues on the Internet.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On most laptops, the internal hard drive and the internal optical drive are connected behind a cover on the underside of the case. On some laptops, the keyboard must be removed to access these drives. Optical drives might not be interchangeable in the laptop. Some laptops may not include optical drives at all.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To view the currently installed storage devices, check the POST screen or BIOS. If installing a second drive or an optical drive, confirm that there are no error icons next to the device in the Device Manager.</p>
