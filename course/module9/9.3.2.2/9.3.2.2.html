        <h1>Power</h1>
        <div>
          <p>These are some signs that the battery, as shown in Figure 1, may need to be replaced:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The battery does not hold a charge.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The battery overheats.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The battery is leaking.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>If you experience problems that you suspect are battery related, exchange the battery with a known, good battery that is compatible with the laptop. If a replacement battery cannot be located, take the battery to an authorized repair center for testing.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A replacement battery must meet or exceed the specifications of the laptop manufacturer. New batteries must use the same form factor as the original battery. Voltages, power ratings, and AC adapters must also meet manufacturer specifications.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Always follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer when charging a new battery. The laptop can be used during an initial charge, but do not unplug the AC adapter.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>CAUTION</b>: Handle batteries with care. Batteries can explode if they are shorted, mishandled, or improperly charged. Be sure that the battery charger is designed for the chemistry, size, and voltage of your battery. Batteries are considered toxic waste and must be disposed of according to local laws.</p>

            <b>Replacing a DC Jack</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A DC jack, as shown in Figure 2, receives power from a laptop’s AC/DC power converter and supplies the power to the motherboard. </p>
          <p>If your DC jack is replaceable, follow these steps:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1:</b> Power off the laptop and disconnect the AC adapter.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2</b>: Remove the battery.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3</b>: Unfasten the DC jack from the case.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4</b>: Unfasten the power cable that is attached to the DC jack.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 5</b>: Disconnect the power cable connector from the motherboard and remove the DC jack from the case.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 6</b>: Connect the power cable connector to the motherboard.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 7</b>: Secure the power cables that are attached to the DC jack to the case.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 8</b>: Secure the DC jack to the case.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 9</b>: Insert the battery.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 10</b>: Connect the AC adapter to the laptop and power on the computer.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> If the DC jack is soldered onto the motherboard, the jack will need to be replaced by someone who knows how to properly use a soldering iron, or the motherboard should be replaced according to the manufacturer of the laptop.</p>
