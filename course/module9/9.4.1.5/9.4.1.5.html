        <h1>Connection Types</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Mobile devices can connect to other devices to use shared peripherals or other resources. They can be wired or wireless connections.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Wired Connections </b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Micro/Mini universal serial bus (USB) connectors</b> – These USB connectors can charge a device and transfer data between devices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Lightning connector</b> – allows Apple mobile devices to connect to host computers and other peripherals, such as USB battery chargers, monitors, and cameras.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Proprietary vendor specific ports</b> – Proprietary vendor specific ports can be found on some mobile devices. These ports are not compatible with other vendors, but often compatibles with other products from the same vendor. These ports are used to charge the device and communicate with other devices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Examples of wired connections are shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Wireless Connections </b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Besides Wi-Fi, mobile devices also use the following wireless connections:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Near field communication (NFC)</b> – NFC enables mobile devices to establish radio communications with other devices by placing the devices close together or by touching them together, as shown in Figure 2.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Infrared (IR)</b> – If a mobile device is IR enabled, it can be used to control other IR controlled devices remotely, such as a TV, set top box, or audio equipment.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Bluetooth</b> – This wireless technology allows data exchange over a short distance between two Bluetooth-enabled devices or connect to other Bluetooth-enabled peripheral devices, such as speakers or headphones.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Shared Internet Connections</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A smartphone’s Internet connection can be shared with other devices. There are two ways to share the smartphone’s Internet connection: tethering and mobile hotspot. The ability to share the connection depends on the cellular carrier and the plan with the carrier.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Tether</b> – This uses your cellular phone as a modem for another device, such as a tablet or laptop. The connection is made over a USB cable or Bluetooth. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Mobile hotspot –</b> A hotspot is where devices connect using WiFi to share a cellular data connection.</li>
            </ul>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page shows two images. The first image shows a micro USB connector and a mini USB connector. The second image shows a lightning connector. Figure 2 on this page illustrates how NFC enables mobile devices to establish radio communications with other devices by placing the devices close together or by touching them together.</div>
