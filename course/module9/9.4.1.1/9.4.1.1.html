        <h1>Mobile Device Parts</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Unlike laptops, mobile devices, such as smartphone and tablets, are typically small enough to be handheld. A smartphone can be carried in a pocket. A tablet can be carried in a purse or small backpack. Because of their small size, mobile devices usually do not have field-serviceable parts. Mobile devices consist of several compact components integrated into a single unit. When a mobile device malfunctions, it is usually sent to the manufacturer for repair or replacement. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are parts and instructions available from many websites for replacing broken mobile device parts, including touchscreens, front or back glass, and batteries. Installing parts from sources other than the manufacturer voids the manufacturer’s warranty and might harm the device. For example, if a replacement battery is installed that does not meet the exact electrical specification for the phone, as shown in Figure 1, the phone could short out or overload, becoming unusable.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Some mobile devices might have one or more of the following field-replaceable parts:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Battery</b> - Some mobile device batteries can be replaced, as shown in Figure 2.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Memory card</b> - Many mobile devices use memory cards to add storage, as shown in Figure 3. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card</b> - This small card contains information used to authenticate a device to mobile telephone and data providers, as shown in Figure 4. SIM cards can also hold user data such as contacts and text messages.</li>
            </ul>
