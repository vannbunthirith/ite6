        <h1>Common Input Devices and LEDs in Laptops</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Laptops are designed to be compact and portable, while maintaining much of the same functionality provided by desktop computers. As a result, essential input devices are built into laptops. When a laptop lid is lifted, the following input devices may be present:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Touchpad</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pointing stick</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Keyboard</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fingerprint readers</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Microphone</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Web camera</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Click the highlighted areas in Figure 1 for more information about the input devices.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Input devices that are built into laptops can be configured in the same manner as input devices for desktops.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Laptops may feature LEDs that show the status of specific devices or components. LEDs are commonly found below the display screen or directly above the keyboard. Click the highlighted areas in Figure 2 for more information on these LEDs.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> LEDs vary by laptop model.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Fig 1 on this page is an image of an open laptop with the following components highlighted. The volume controls are buttons that control audio output. The power button is a control that turns the laptop on and off. The keyboard is a compact input device and has multi-functional keys. The input devices are the touchpad, which consists of right and left click buttons, and a pointer controller. The touchpad and pointer controller can be used instead of a mouse for the laptop. The fingerprint reader is an input device used for security authentication. Figure 2 on this page is an image of a laptop display with the following eight LEDs at the bottom of the display highlighted. The wireless LED indicates the activity of the wireless network connection. The Bluetooth status LED indicates when the Bluetooth wireless transceiver is enabled. The Num Lock LED indicates the on/off status of the 10-key number pad. The caps lock LED indicates the on/off status of the caps lock. The hard drive activity LED indicates the activity of the hard drive. The power on LED indicates the on/off status of the laptop. The battery status LED indicates the status of the laptop battery. The hibernate or standby LED indicates whether the computer is in standby mode or if it is entering or leaving hibernate mode.</div>
