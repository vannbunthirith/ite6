        <h1>Wearable Devices</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Wearable devices are clothing or accessories that have miniature computing devices. Smart watches, fitness monitors, and smart headsets are some examples.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Smart Watches</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Smart watches are watches that combine the functions of a watch and some functions of mobile devices. Some smartwatches also include sensors to measure body and environmental metrics such as heart rate, body temperature, elevation, or air temperature. They have touchscreen displays, and they can function on their own or paired with smartphones. These watches can display notifications of incoming messages, incoming phone calls, and social media updates. Smartwatches can run apps on the watch or via a smartphone. They may also allow the users to control some functions, such as music and camera, on a smartphone.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Fitness Monitors</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Fitness monitors are designed to clip onto clothing or be worn on the wrist. They are used for tracking a person’s daily activity and body metrics as they work toward their fitness goals. These devices measure and collect activity data. They can also connect with other Internet-connected devices to upload the data for later review. Some fitness monitors may also have basic smartwatch capabilities, such as displaying caller ID and text messages.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Smart Headsets</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Smart headsets are designed to be worn like a pair of eyeglasses. The headset has a small screen built into the frame or projected onto glass. The headset is often connected to a smartphone for network connectivity. Functions might be controlled by a touchpad on the side or voice commands. These devices have many of the same functions as smartphones. A user can see notifications, read emails, get directions, or take calls via the headset rather than on a smartphone. The display is always visible to the wearer, all they have to do is focus on it.</p>
