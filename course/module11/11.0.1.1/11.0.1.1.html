        <h1>Chapter 11: Printers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Printers produce paper copies of electronic files. Many situations, such as government regulations, require physical records; therefore, hard copies of computer documents are often as important today as they were when the paperless revolution began several years ago.</p>
          <p>This chapter provides essential information about printers. You will learn how printers operate, what to consider when purchasing a printer, and how to connect printers to an individual computer or to a network. </p>
          <p>You must understand the operation of various types of printers to be able to install and maintain them, as well as troubleshoot any problems that arise.</p>
