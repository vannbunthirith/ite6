        <h1>Hardware Optimization</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Some printers can be upgraded to print faster and to accommodate more print jobs by adding hardware. The hardware may include additional paper trays, sheet feeders, network cards, and expansion memory.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Firmware</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Firmware is a set of instructions stored on the printer. The firmware controls how the printer operates. The procedure to upgrade firmware is similar to installing printer drivers. Because firmware updates do not take place automatically, visit the home page of the printer manufacturer to check the availability of new firmware. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Printer Memory</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>All printers have RAM, such as the chips shown in the figure. Printers usually arrive from the factory with enough memory to handle jobs that involve text. However, print jobs involving graphics, and especially photographs, run more efficiently if the printer memory is adequate to store the entire job before it starts. Upgrading the printer memory increases the printing speed and enhances complex print job performance. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Print job buffering is when a print job is captured in the internal printer memory. Buffering allows the computer to continue with other work instead of waiting for the printer to finish. Buffering is a common feature in laser printers and plotters, as well as in advanced inkjet and dot matrix printers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If you receive low memory errors, this can indicate that the printer is out of memory or has a memory overload. In this instance, you may need more memory.</p>
