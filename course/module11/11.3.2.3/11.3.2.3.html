        <h1>Hardware Print Servers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A hardware print server is a simple device with a network card and memory. It connects to the network and communicates with the printer to enable print sharing. The print server in Figure 1 is connected to the printer through a USB cable. A hardware print server may be integrated with another device, such as a wireless router. In this case, the printer would connect directly to the wireless router, most likely through a USB cable. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Apple’s AirPort Extreme shown in Figure 2 is an example of a hardware print server. Through the AirPrint service, the AirPort Extreme can share a printer with any device on the network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Hardware print servers allow many users on a network to access a single printer. A hardware print server can manage network printing through either wired or wireless connections. An advantage of using a hardware print server is that the server accepts incoming print jobs from computers, thereby freeing the computers for other tasks. A hardware print server is always available to users, unlike a printer shared from a user's computer. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is a topology that shows the following devices connected to a central wireless router: A Mac OS X PC, a Windows laptop, and a Windows PC, all connected cable. An Apple iPad and an Android phone, both connected using wireless. A printer is connected to a print server using a USB connection that is also connected to the wireless router. Figure 2 on this page is an image of an Apple AirPort Extreme print server.</div>
