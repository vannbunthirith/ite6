        <h1>Types of Print Drivers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Printer drivers are software programs that make it possible for computers and printers to communicate with each other. Configuration software provides an interface that enables users to set and change printer options. Every printer model has its own type of driver and configuration software.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Page Description Language (PDL) is a type of code that describes the appearance of a document in a language that a printer can understand. The PDL for a page includes the text, graphics, and formatting information. A software application uses a PDL to send What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) images to the printer. The printer translates the PDL file so that whatever is on the computer screen is what is printed. PDLs speed up the printing process by sending large amounts of data at one time. They also manage the computer fonts.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Adobe Systems developed PostScript to allow fonts and text types to share the same characteristics on the screen as on paper. Hewlett-Packard developed Printer Command Language (PCL) for communication with early inkjet printers. PCL is now an industry standard for nearly all printer types.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure on this page is a table that lists the following comparison between Adobe PostScript and Hewlett-Packard's PCL. PostScript: Page is rendered by the printer, better quality output, handles more complex print jobs, output is identical on different printers. PCL: Page is rendered on local workstation, faster print jobs, requires less printer memory, output varies slightly on different printers.</div>
