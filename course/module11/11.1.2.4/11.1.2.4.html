      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page is an interactive activity that checks the learner’s understanding of laser printing processes. Processing, the printer converts data from common languages, such as PS or PCL, to a bitmap image stored in the printer’s memory. Charging, the previous latent image on the drum is removed and the drum is conditioned for the new latent image by the corona wire. Exposing, to write the image, the photosensitive drum is exposed with the laser beam. As the drum turns, an invisible latent image is created on the drum. Developing, the toner is applied to the latent image on the drum. Transferring, the toner attached to the latent image is transferred to the paper. Fusing, the toner is permanently fused to the paper. As the paper moves through the rollers, the loose toner is melted and fused with the fibers in the paper. The paper is then moved to the output tray as a printed page. Cleaning, when an image has been deposited on the paper and the drum has separated from the paper, the remaining toner must be removed from the drum by a blade or a wire. Figure 2 on this page is an interactive activity that checks the learner’s understanding of the order of the laser printing processes: 1 Processing, 2 Charging, 3 Exposing, 4 Developing, 5 Transferring, 6 Fusing, 7 Cleaning.</div>
