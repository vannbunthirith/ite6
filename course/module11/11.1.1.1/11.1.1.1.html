        <h1>Characteristics and Capabilities of Printers</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As a computer technician, you might be required to purchase, repair, or maintain a printer. The customer might request that you perform the following tasks: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Select a printer</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Install and configure a printer</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Troubleshoot a printer</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The printers available today are usually either laser printers using imaging drums or inkjet printers using electrostatic spray technology. Dot matrix printers using impact technology are used in applications that require carbon copies. Figure 1 shows three types of printers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Capabilities and Speed</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Printer capabilities and speed are factors to consider when selecting a printer. The speed of a printer is measured in pages per minute (ppm). Printer speed varies between makes and models. Speed is also affected by the complexity of the image and the quality desired by the user. For example, a draft quality page of text prints faster than a high-quality page of text. A draft quality image of a color digital photograph prints faster than a photo quality print. Inkjet printers are usually slower, but they are often sufficient for a home or small office. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Color or Black and White</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The color printing process uses the primary colors cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY).  For inkjet printing, the color black servers as the base or key color. Thus, the acronym CMYK refers to the inkject color printing process. Figure 2 shows a CMYK color wheel. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The choice between a black-and-white printer and a color printer depends on the needs of the customer. If the customer is primarily printing letters and does not need color capability, a black-and-white printer is sufficient and can be less expensive. An elementary school teacher might need a color printer to add excitement to lessons.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Quality</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The quality of printing is measured in dots per inch (dpi). The larger the dpi number, the better the image resolution. When the resolution is higher, text and images are clearer. To produce the best high-resolution images, use high-quality ink or toner and high-quality paper. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Reliability</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A printer should be reliable. Because so many types of printers are on the market, research the specifications of several printers before selecting one. Here are some manufacturer options to consider:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Warranty - Identify what is covered within the warranty. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Scheduled servicing - Servicing is based on expected usage. Usage information is in the documentation or on the manufacturer’s website. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Mean time between failures (MTBF) - The printer should work without failing for an average length of time. This information is in the documentation or on the manufacturer's website. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Total Cost of Ownership</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When buying a printer, there is more than just the initial cost of the printer to consider. The total cost of ownership (TCO) includes a number of factors:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Initial purchase price </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cost of supplies, such as paper and ink</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pages per month</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Price per page </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maintenance costs </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Warranty costs </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>When calculating the TCO, consider the amount of printing required and the expected lifetime of the printer.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 on this page shows images of the following three printers: a dot matrix printer, an ink jet printer, and a laser printer. Figure 2 on this page is an image of a CMYK colour wheel. The colour wheel shows the following groups of colours clockwise from the top: Purple, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, dark blue. Each colour group consists of small tiles of different shades of the main colour. The tiles spiral into the center of the wheel with the darkest shades on the outside of the wheel with the other tiles progressively getting lighter towards the center of the wheel which is white. The figure also shows a greyscale slider and edit boxes for entering RGB colour codes, CMYK colour codes, and Hexadecimal colour codes.</div>
